N2  - Computer education is in the midst of a major transformation as a result of the rapid emergence of new technologies, intersection of computing with other disciplines and growing interest among students in computing courses. Such transformation prompted educators to redefine the way computing education is delivered and experiment a wide range of learning approaches. One of these approaches is the integration of hardware prototyping platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Intel Internet of Things as part of project-based learning. These platforms have become in recent years instrumental tools for improving students' learning process and promoting proactive thinking. The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of integrating low cost open-source hardware platforms into engineering and computer science courses. In particular, we explore the use of an experiential learning approach using these kits for improving the students' learning experience in computer science and engineering courses. Throughout this paper, we discuss the outcome of our investigation and provide insights on how to make classrooms more experiential using the hardware prototyping paradigm.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi is a small computer useful for teaching students basic computer knowledge. This paper discusses the integration of the Raspberry Pi in an introductory information systems course. Previously, the initial course in the College of Engineering and Information Sciences was a general applications course not focused on computer science or engineering. A new course was developed integrating the raspberry pi with hands on labs to improve student engagement. The initial course should be exciting and motivating to students. By creating a new course with interesting labs that integrate the Raspberry Pi, higher pass rates and student satisfaction will be achieved.

N2  - By design, the computer science curriculum for undergraduate students in the United States does not include enough hands-on courses such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. It is difficult for students, especially the Distance Learners (DL) to appreciate the power of computer science as a problem-solving field without real-world experiments. Furthermore, students in computer science may drop-out or turn away from the field because it does not offer an opportunity for them to communicate with each other during online/traditional labs. In this paper, an active learning project-based approach in online/traditional computer science courses is introduced to make the courses' material more attractive to students from minorities. Students obtain a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world problems. Students will enjoy the challenges they face when developing solutions. This paper studies the impact of hands-on project-based learning using Raspberry Pi on students taking online and face-To-face computer science courses at Old Dominion University. 2019 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents an adaptive framework (web application) that supports secure, end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT) sensing architecture, which includes loosely coupled set of components with well-defined interfaces that can be adapted to a wide range of uses. Moreover, the framework was adopted in a Computer Science (CS) Fog computing course to get formal evaluation by undergraduate students. IoT has emerged as a new network paradigm, involving connecting physical world through sensors (temperature, humidity, intensity, etc.) to the Internet, to provide opportunities for building intelligent systems and applications. There are a few notable characteristics of todayâ€™s IoT systems that serve as impediments for greater adoption. First, the common, well-documented platform that spans end-to-end, and which can cover a multitude of practical uses, is still missing. The second impediment is the lack of standard energy-efficient platform. Third, with the growing deployment of IoT devices, the attack vector for possible exploitation increases, which dictates an increase in the ongoing cost to ensure Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability triad. In this project, we propose the solution to address these impediments. The proposed framework makes it economical and easy to adapt to (e.g. to learn and to support). The next benefit comes with the use of environment harvesting equipment (solar cell, in-line hydro-generators, thermoelectric cells, etc.) and use of energy efficient coding methods, including security and communication provisions. Overall, the project successfully integrates Amazon Cloud technologies, Raspberry-Pi and Arduino embedded systems using energy-harvesting technologies, secure communication using government standards, and highly available network of nodes using wireless technology into a Cloud-of-Things (CoF).The methodology allows a myriad IoT devices connected to the Internet to be easily monitored and manipulated through the implemented web application. On the other hand, since few dedicated IoT courses are currently offered, most Science, technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students will have limited or no exposure to IoT development until after graduation, and inadequately prepared in IoT development to enter into the workforce. Therefore, the implemented framework was introduced in a CS special topic course to get comments and formal evaluations from undergraduate STEM students. An outline of a well-developed courseware is presented in the paper. The courseware is evaluated through survey questions. The majority of the students provided positive feedback and enjoyed the IoT framework.

N2  - It is widely recognized that motivating students in an undergraduate assembly language course is a tremendous challenge, principally because of the perception that the subject matter is both difficult and tedious. The Raspberry Pi is a small and inexpensive single-board computer that was created for educational purposes, and in this paper we describe how we successfully incorporated this device into the curriculum of an undergraduate assembly language course. We describe, in detail, the objectives for this course and the dedicated lab that uses the Raspberry Pi as an embedded device, and then evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings (obtained by exploring changes in student performance and examining the results of an engagement/enjoyment survey) strongly indicate that the introduction of the Raspberry Pi was well received by the students and contributed positively to their learning outcomes.

N2  - This paper presents our experience implementing a newly designed introduction to computing course for first year undergraduate students. The redesigned course focuses on the use of Raspberry Pi microcomputers as a common computing platform in order to encourage student experimentation and fun in a relatively low-cost environment. The course we describe represents a departure at our university from a traditional first-semester introduction to computing which emphasized foundational technical and mathematical skills but less exploration of the field of computing in a more wholistic manner. Our new course focuses on exposure to computing through experimentation. Additionally, it emphasizes community building among the students as well as affording them the opportunity to bring their creativity to bear in a final project showcase. As a result, the course is proving to be attractive not just to traditional computing majors but to a wider swath of the university community. This paper describes the topics selected in the redesign of the course, a summary of the labs involved, a discussion of assignments, and a description of the final project process. We discuss feedback received from students and the overall perception of the course among students and faculty. We also reflect on our experiences from redesigning the course and provide advice for those wishing to adopt a similar introductory course.

N2  - With the requirement that parallel distributed computing (PDC) topics be covered in the core computer science curriculum, educators are exploring new ways to engage students in this area of computing. In this paper, we discuss the use of the Raspberry Pi single-board computer (SBC) to provide students with hands-on multicore learning experiences. We discuss how the authors use the Raspberry Pi to teach parallel computing, and present assessment results that indicate such devices are effective at achieving CS2013 PDC learning outcomes, as well as motivating further study of parallelism. We believe our results are of significant interest to CS educators looking to integrate parallelism in their classrooms, and support the use of other SBCs for teaching parallel computing. 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - Most universities are still using microprocessor training board that equipped with Intel 8086 to introduce students about assembly language and computer architecture due to its popularity and availability. The Intel 8086 is the first x86 microprocessor, it is no longer suitable to introduce students to the modern x86 architecture. A new microprocessor that featured modern architecture design is needed to maintain the competency of university students to keep pace with the fast advancing computer technology. Intel Galileo is a single board computer board that equipped with Intel Quark X1000 SoC. We successfully developed new approach for programming the device using assembly language. Supporting lab materials, example codes, macros, and procedures are developed to incorporate the Intel Galileo board into the laboratory experiments design for microprocessor course. The proposed laboratory experiments allow undergraduate students to learn IA-32 instruction sets and protected mode programming. The results from pre-post-test and quantitative survey shows that Intel Galileo board is effective to support the learning of the IA-32 assembly language and computer architecture.

N2  - This article presents a low-cost laboratory that has been designed and developed to enhance learning experience and help students gain skills and knowledge in the field of distributed systems. In order to build a comprehensive distributed file system, we used the laboratory consisting of 40 card-sized Raspberry Pi devices, with the accent on stability, scalability, and low cost. Aiming to assess the impact of this new learning environment on the learning process and its outcomes, we surveyed students following the completion of three project stages during the 17 laboratory exercises in one academic year, ensuring that we maintained the same subjects of study during the experiments. Supported by interesting answers on various sets of questions, we provide a valuable insight into students' experience, obstacles and observations during system's implementation. This particular insight paves the way toward further laboratory improvement, adopting this approach in other courses related to ours, and encouraging teachers to embrace similar practice regardless of the field of education. 1979-2012 IEEE.

N2  - Understanding, promoting, and teaching media literacy is an important societal challenge. STEM educators are increasingly looking to incorporate 21stcentury skills such as media literacy into core subject education. In this paper we investigate how undergraduate Computer Science (CS) students can learn media literacy as a by-product of collaborative video tutorial production. The paper presents a study of 34 third-year CS undergraduates who, as part of their learning, were each asked to produce three video tutorials on Raspberry Pi programming, using a collaborative video production tool for mobile phones (Bootlegger). We provide results of both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the production process and resulting video tutorials, and conclude that the student cohort demonstrated a clear development of media literacy skills. The paper's contribution is twofold. First, we add to the understanding of how the use of mobile collaborative video production technology by non-professionals can help them learn to create meaningful media messages with little scaffolding. Second, we present an alternative pedagogical approach that can help CS students acquire 21stcentury skills such as media literacy.

N2  - With rapid advances in the emerging and pervasive field of the Internet of Things, electrical and electronic engineering students need a robust grasp of embedded computational device principles to make a proper, appreciable and relevant contribution. This necessity is more pertinent in developing countries that are technologically lagging behind their developed counterparts. This paper analyses the teaching modalities and models used to teach embedded device theory. A new triumvirate (or three person group) hybrid blended learning model is proposed and used to instruct mid-level students in the Electrical and Information Engineering Department of the University of Nairobi; on two embedded device types: a custom board using an AVR Atmega88A series micro-controller and the Raspberry Pi single-board computer. Student circuit design ability and programming confidence prior and subsequent to the proposed method were used to assess the efficacy of the triumvirate model. From the preliminary iteration of the learning model program, it was found that the model is a viable method of ensuring persistent knowledge transfer of embedded design concepts and can be developed further. 2017 IEEE.

N2  - In today's environment, where every computer, including cell phones, are multicore, it is essential that students develop parallel programming skills. It remains a challenge to develop effective techniques for teaching parallel programing skills. Another challenge is finding time within already packed lectures to cover additional material. To that end, we investigate the effectiveness of using Project Based Learning (PBL) to teach parallel programming skills early in the curriculum by developing and incorporating a PBL module into CSc 3210 (Computer Organization and Programming). This is a core course taken by all computer science majors and is a prerequisite to many of our senior-level classes. In our case study, 124 students are organized into 26 diverse groups, with four or five students per group, and assigned five project assignments, each of two-weeks duration. Given a Raspberry PI, students will explore its multicore architecture and create programs for shared memory parallelism using OpenMP and C language. Our results show that incorporating this PBL module has a significant and direct effect on the student's growth in parallel programming skills. As a side benefit, we also show that there is a direct improvement on a student's personal growth in terms soft skills, which is essential in the professional development and success in the workplace. By having students experience PBL in an early class, close to the midpoint of the academic program, it can serve as a mini-capstone project. Furthermore, students can collaboratively learn by themselves (through teamwork) and apply the fundamentals of parallel programming skills without the need for separate lectures, labs, or workshops. 2019 IEEE.
