N2  - DM3730 (and OMAP3530) high-performance, multicore processor based development boards (such as the Beagleboard-xm) with according software solutions and development tools is an efficient platform for various computing, signal and image processing applications, with various connectivity options. For the high performance impedance (and complex network) spectrum analyzer solutions, a critical role play realization of the data converters (ADC and DAC) and their interfacing to the processor. Analog-to digital conversion can be performed by external 16-18 bit ADCs, with serial interfaces working in the under-sampled mode. For the DAC part the main challenge is the generation of the accurate multi-frequency (better, if arbitrary) excitation waveforms. Using of the processors internal 10-bit video DACs (having many benefits, compared with using of the similar external DACs) for this purpose have been investigated, for the possibly high accuracy (14-18 bit effective overall accuracy) and wideband (up to 5 to 10 MHz, analogue signals) arbitrary waveform generations. First experiments show good hope to develop an efficient and cost- and form- effective OMAP (open multimedia application platform) based impedance (or complex network analyzer) solution with very competitive metrological characteristics. Investigation results so far are described.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - One of the most demanding challenges in the field of audio engineering is the transmission of low-latency high quality audio streams over networks. While several protocols nowadays allow wired local network streaming, much effort is still required to achieve similar goals over existing wireless LAN technologies. While the challenge is still far from being solved, several design issues can be highlighted and future scenarios can be outlined. This paper proposes the setup of a wireless music production system based on open hardware and open software which requires relatively low setup effort while allowing for a high flexibility of use. The hardware platform is the Beagleboard, based on Texas Instruments DM3730, running a GNU/Linux OS and the computer music language Pure Data. Such a device can capture electric instrument audio, generate sound, send MIDI or OSC control data, and stream to PCs and other embedded devices operating as mixers, effect racks and so on, enabling an ecosystem of flexible and open devices. Tests conducted on a home wireless network show acceptable latency for many applications.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper we present a fast implementation of an automatic non-photorealistic image processing technique which transforms an input image frame of a video stream into a non-photorealistic abstracted cartoon stylised render. The approach presented utilises a fast cosine integral image method to create a separable bilateral filtering stage which operates in constant time. This is subsequently put through a colour quantisation stage and combined with an edge overlay system to generate the abstracted image output. The algorithm is implemented with OpenCV on a Beagleboard-xM running Angstrom GNU/Linux to demonstrate the improved performance obtained utilising the cosine integral image bilateral filter over the OpenCV standard bilateral filter implementation, and to demonstrate further performance improvements can be obtained through utilising optimised routines on the ARM NEON floating point unit of the Beagleboard-xM.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents an extended algorithm for Real-time Compressive Tracking using Cosine Similarity Metric for object tracking. The method utilises a weighted multi-frame cosine similarity metric with the ground truth bounding box and a recently computed target bounding box. In comparison to the original algorithm it is capable of handling fast motion with a greater degree of accuracy. The proposed algorithm has been benchmarked on a desktop computer and subsequently implemented on a Texas Instruments ARM based DM3730 Beagleboard-xM. The proposed algorithm demonstrates a significant performance increase in fast motion video sequences. In addition, the low computational complexity of the algorithm makes it well suited for embedded applications.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - Arduino and Raspberry Pi are the most popular open source hardware in the world which are invented with the hope of inspiring generation of students to learn programming and be creative. The former is a simple AVR microprocessor but powered by simple programming IDE and the complete open hardware ecosystem. The latter is a powerful ARM based mini PC but it is not very easy to get started if users has no enough programming background. To combine the advantages of both an ARM based mini PC and the complete Arduino ecosystem. LinkSprite released a powerful mini PC platform: pcDuino, which represents PC + Arduino.

N2  - A Texas-based software architect, Robert Savage, has developed an automated sunrise/sunset timer for holiday light displays. The device is powered by a Raspberry Pi microcontroller, a small single-board computer conceived to teach computer science in schools. The microcontroller is connected to a PowerSwitch Tail actuated switch, which means the mechanism can be plugged into a standard 120-Vac household outlet. Savage wrote an open-source Java application that calculates sunrise and sunset times based on latitude and longitude data, to control the circuit. Savage provides step-by-step instructions, including links to the open source software and suggestions for program modifications.

N2  - Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is a sampling-based algorithm for mobile robot localization. In this paper we describe an MCL assignment and its required hardware and software. The Neato vacuum robot and a Raspberry Pi serve as the core of the robot model. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is used as the robot programming environment. Students are expected to learn the localization problem, implement the MCL algorithm, and better understand the kidnapped robot problem and the limitations of MCL by observing the performance of the algorithm in real-time application.

N2  - This work was intended to direct the choice of an image interpolation/zoom algorithm for use in UND's Open Prototype for Educational Nanosats (OPEN) satellite program. Whether intended for a space-borne platform or a balloon-borne platform, we expect to use a low cost camera (Raspberry Pi) and expect to have very limited bandwidth for image transmission. However, the technique developed could be used for any imaging application. The approach developed analyzes overlapping 3 3 blocks of pixels looking for 'L' patterns that suggest the center pixel should be changed such that a triangle pattern results. We compare this approach against different types of single-frame image interpolation algorithms, such as zero-order-hold (ZOH), bilinear, bicubic, and the directional cubic convolution interpolation (DCCI) approach. We use the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE) as the primary means of comparison. In all but one of the test cases the proposed method resulted in a lower MSE and higher PSNR than the other methods. Meaning this method results in a more accurate image after zooming than the other methods.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Motion capture (MoCap) has been one of the leading and most useful tools within the field of animation to capture fluid and detailed motion. However, it can be quite expensive for animators, game developers and educators on a tight budgets. By using Raspberry Pi Zeros, with NoIR cameras and IR LED light rings, the cost of a four-camera system can potentially be reduced to less than 1000 USD. The research described should lead to an effective and useful system, able to detect multiple markers, record their coordinates, and keep track of them as they move. With a setup of three or more cameras, one would be able to triangulate the data on a low-cost host computer. All software and hardware designs will be disseminated open source, providing anyone who is interested in MoCap, whether it be for hobbyist, semi-professional, or educational purposes, a system for a fraction of the typical cost.  2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - Robust security on a commodity low-cost and popular computing platform is a worthy goal for today's Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded ecosystems. We present the first practical security architecture on the Raspberry PI (PI), a ubiquitous and popular low-cost compute module. Our architecture and framework - called UBERPI - focuses on three goals which are keys to achieving practical security: commodity compatibility (e.g., runs unmodified Raspbian/Debian Linux) and unfettered access to platform hardware, performance (avg. 2%-6% overhead), and low trusted computing base and complexity (modular 5544 SLoC).We present a full implementation followed by a comprehensive evaluation and lessons learned. We believe that our contributions and findings elevate the PI into a next generation, secure, low-cost IoT embedded computing platform.  2018 IEEE.

The power consumption measurements are performed at electric charge level and not at electric current level so as not to miss the sudden energy drains the radio transmit operation is invoking. Furthermore, the radio behaviour (e.g. transmit power or data rate modification) can be easily controlled via simple commands, sent via a conventional smart phone, making the overall setup ideal for educational purposes or not very experienced personnel.  2018

N2  - With the vigorous development of modern science technologies and the rising cost of human resources, many modern factories and stores have introduced various robotic arms to replace humans to accomplish tedious work. Particularly in an unmanned store, the time used for ordering, making, and delivering food can be reduced as well. Accordingly, this work develops and integrates three subtasks which are the Application (APP) software for ordering, Raspberry Pi for computation, and robotic arm for delivering the ordered items to fulfill the unmanned shop. The APP is implemented by Java to interact with a customer via a smart phone. The order message is then sent to the Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth. The camera on the robotic arm is to take the picture of donuts, which is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi via USB. The Gaussian mixture model is adopted to obtain the adaptive thresholds to segment the foreground and background of the captured picture. The top donut(s) in the foreground are extracted by the GraphCut scheme with the automatic line marking, and determined by the shape characteristics. The extracted top donut(s) are then recognized by the modified MobileNetV2 of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify their flavors. Once the identified donut matches the flavor selected by a customer, the distance between the robotic arm and the central point of the selected donut is derived. Additionally, the corresponding angles of six axes of the robotic arm are calculated as well. Based on the calculated angles, the robotic arm starts the movement, grabs the donut, and put it on the tray. The experimental results reveal that our robotic arm can effectively reach the target at the average accuracy rate of 95% for identifying nine donut flavors by using the proposed CNN. Through the integration of these three subtasks, we have successfully created the unmanned shop service to facilitate the development of new business models.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Humans are social creatures. We learn by connecting with those around us, through communication. While people with hearing or visual impairments alone can find a way to share their thoughts with others and understand them, deaf-blind people face a much more difficult communication task. Here, appropriate technology can play a decisive role. The small size and low power consumption of ARM-based computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, have opened the door for many embedded applications, including a heart monitoring method and an assistive navigation system for the blind. Some estimates place the number of deaf-blind people in the U.S. at around 40,000 individuals. While a commercial view considers this a small market, thus making communication devices not commercially viable; from a humanitarian view, this is a significant number of people who would greatly benefit from a technological means of communication. This paper presents the design, prototype and testing of a portable keyboard and speaker device with a braille refreshable display for the communication between two people (either being deaf- blind) that has both, a comparatively low cost, and many possibilities for further development on the ARM-based computer system.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - Verbal communication is one of the best way to behaviors of proclamation for humans, to give and take thought, feeling and relevant data. Speech is the most capable way to teach a device or talk with a device. Detection systems lies on hidden Markov models is doing well less than exacting situation, due to experience as of chief limitations that maximum value of applications of ASR technology in real-world surroundings. However, with in the past decade, several attempt includes to estimate the HMM deficiency. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and more specifically Multi-Layer Perception's (MLP) appeared to be a promising alternative in this respect to replace or help HMM in the classification mode. Algorithms are applied to reduce the noise interference and silence suppression. The signal free from above interference is then processed to extract the features. MFCC is used as a feature extraction technique. It will be applied through raspberry pi to device like FAN, BULB through cloud.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - The feasibility of using embedded systems in real-life applications is becoming more widespread. These applications have grown from do-it-yourself projects of computer enthusiasts or robotics projects to larger scale efforts and deployments. This paper describes a scenario that deployed a prototype application that allows the public to interact with features of a model and view videos from a first-person perspective on the train. Through testing the embedded systems and their usage in a public setting, it was demonstrated that interactive features could be implemented in model train exhibits, which are featured in traditional museum environments that lack technical infrastructure. Specifically, the Arduino and Raspberry Pi provide the necessary linkages between the Internet and hardware, allowing for a greater interactive experience for museum visitors. These results provide an important use-case scenario and lessons learned that cultural heritage institutions can use when implementing embedded systems on a larger scale, for the purpose of increasing visitors' experience through greater interaction and engagement.

N2  - This paper describes the implementation of an inexpensive 'do-it-yourself (DIY)' smart home system which allows for an unobtrusive and non-invasive monitoring system of the elderly's well-being in their own home using motion sensors. The system gathers the data from the sensors to learn and understand the behaviors of elderlies throughout the day. The activities will be presented to family members in a user-friendly manner via Android apps so that they can make better informed decisions with regards to ensuring the elderlies' safety and well-being. Alerts will be sent to both the elderly's mobile as well as that of family member when the system detects anomalies. The implementation involves the use of Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensors, connected to a Raspberry Pi (RPi 3). Data is stored at a backend for processing. The elderly's activities and alerts displayed or sent to a mobile application developed for this purpose.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In the paper several approaches to building the real-time basic principle simulators of nuclear reactor processes are presented and their characteristics are analyzed. The characteristics of developed simulators for MATLAB/Simulink including their limitations, and the idea of a cross-platform simulator independent of specific hardware or software are presented. Mathematical models of selected nuclear reactor's processes with special emphasis on the durations of their transient states and the desired step in the simulation are characterized. Architecture of the simulator, code development and its implementations on different hardware platforms (PC and Raspberry PI) and on different operating systems (Windows, Linux, Raspbian) are presented. Studies were performed to obtain the minimum possible simulation steps while maintaining regime operation in real-time on each platform. Comparison of compliances with the reference simulator and assessment of suitability of the various versions of simulators to educational and research tasks were carried out. Concept of the simulator operated using a web browser is considered.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - Many devices can inform the user of everything from a visitors arrival at the door to a dangerous gas leak detection. For hearing-impaired people, there are some devices that can notify using light, etc., rather than by sound. However, these are individual devices and are relatively expensive due to their limited production volume. In this paper, a neural network was used as a method to classify alarm sounds of eight types of equipment. Two feature elements such as power spectrum and Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) are taken as feature quantities to enter in this network, and its performance was evaluated. We implemented a neural network learned model on a Raspberry Pi and constructed a system that transmits classification results to a smartphone via Bluetooth. We generated 8 types of alarm sounds, plus indoor environmental sounds and speech sounds, for a total of ten kinds of sounds in the actual use environment of the classification experiment. This produced classification rates of 83.0% and 82.0% in experiments using learned models generated by power spectrum and MFCC. For the 8 alarm sounds, the classification rate was 87.5% by power spectrum and 77.5% by MFCC. It was confirmed that good performance could be obtained if power spectrum is used to determine feature elements in alarm sound classification.  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - In India, it is observed that the number of people losing their lives in road accidents especially on highways is more than the death resulting due to naxalite, terrorism activity or epidemic. Government is investing plenty of money to educate people regarding road safety and curb death due to accidents, but people used to avoid it and entering themselves into danger zone. Several lives could be saved if the person(s) make use of helmet and wear seat belts while driving vehicles. Further, it is next to impossible for traffic police to catch each rider violating traffic rules, thus there is a need of the system to identify people disobeying road safety guideline which involves use of helmet and seat belt. The idea is to impose appropriate fine on such people to force them follow the road safety guidelines. Bike-riders without helmet and driving four wheeler without wearing seatbelt should be caught. Authors have performed four feature extraction techniques namely Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), Template Matching and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF(ORB) to detect objects like vehicles, helmets, number plates, seatbelts for traffic data sets on Raspberry Pi 2 (B) using OpenCV3.0 and Python 3.4.2. These feature extraction techniques have been evaluated on collected dataset and simulation results performed on raspberry pi on valid dataset. The observation suggests that SIFT algorithm can be used to get higher accuracy compared to SURF and ORB for rule violators at toll system on highways or traffic cross road in city.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Contemporary IoT systems are challenging to develop, deploy, and maintain. This is because of their ever-increasing scale, dynamic network topologies, heterogeneity and resource constraints of the involved devices, and failures that may occur as a result of these characteristics. Existing approaches are either not at the right level of abstraction, require developers to learn specialized languages, or miss certain key features to address all these challenges in a uniform manner. In this paper we leverage reactive programming and code mobility to support the entire life-cycle of large-scale IoT systems. Our approach is based on existing programming technologies and offers simple and composable abstractions to developers. We implemented our approach in a middleware called Potato and used it to develop and deploy an IoT application on a Raspberry Pi cluster. We found that using Potato reduces much of the accidental complexity associated with developing and deploying IoT systems, resulting in clean and maintainable programs.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - IoT devices should be easy to deploy and able to endure long periods of activity in the field without further intervention. LoRaWAN is geared to attain these objectives. European developers can easily leverage the public gateways of The Things Networks (TTN) already installed to obtain connectivity for LoRaWAN end-devices. In many developing countries Internet access cannot be taken for granted thus precluding the use of TTN. In this paper, we present a solution that allows connecting local IoT end-nodes to a LoRaWAN gateway without the need of internet access, at low cost and with low power consumption. We implement the three building blocks of the LoRaWAN architecture (Gateway, Network Server and Application Server) in a single box based on a Raspberry Pi and a LoRaWAN module. Local access to the application data is offered via a WiFi Access Point, allowing community members to access their community data even when there is no Internet access. In addition to real time IoT data, bulletin board like services can be implemented in the local repository to provide educational, health and other content that addresses the most pressing needs of isolated communities. The complete box with mentioned capabilities constitutes then the Base Station (BS).  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Remote attestation is a crucial security service particularly relevant to increasingly popular IoT (and other embedded) devices. It allows a trusted party (verifier) to learn the state of a remote, and potentially malware-infected, device (prover). Most existing approaches are static in nature and only check whether benign software is initially loaded on the prover. However, they are vulnerable to runtime attacks that hijack the application's control or data flow, e.g., via return-oriented programming or data-oriented exploits. As a concrete step towards more comprehensive runtime remote attestation, we present the design and implementation of Control-FLow ATtestation (C-FLAT) that enables remote attestation of an application's control-flow path, without requiring the source code. We describe a full prototype implementation of C-FLAT on Raspberry Pi using its ARM TrustZone hardware security extensions. We evaluate C-FLAT's performance using a real-world embedded (cyber-physical) application, and demonstrate its efficacy against control-flow hijacking attacks.  2016 ACM.

N2  - An important issue faced while employing Pyroelectric InfraRed (PIR) sensors in an outdoor Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployment for intrusion detection, is that the output of the PIR sensor can, as shown in a recent paper, degenerate into a weak and unpredictable signal when the background temperature is close to that of the intruder. The current paper explores the use of an optical camera as a complementary sensing modality in an outdoor WSN deployment to reliably handle such situations. A combination of backgroundsubtraction and the Lucas-Kanade optical-flow algorithms is used to classify between human and animal in an outdoor environment based on video data.,The algorithms were developed keeping in mind the need for the camera to act when called upon, as a substitute for the PIR sensor by turning in comparable classification accuracies. All algorithms are implemented on a mote in the case of the PIR sensor array and on an Odroid single-board computer in the case of the optical camera. Three sets of experimental results are presented. The first set shows the optical-camera platform to turn in under supervised learning, high accuracy classification (in excess of 95%) comparable to that of the PIR sensor array. The second set of results correspond to an outdoor WSN deployment over a period of 7 days where similar accuracies are achieved. The final set also corresponds to a single-day outdoor WSN deployment and shows that the optical camera can act as a stand-in for the PIR sensor array when the ambient temperature conditions cause the PIR sensor to perform poorly.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Public transportation around midsize educational cities has become increasingly vital as residential and commuter populations continue to grow every year. Our research team proposes a cyber-physical system that monitors the quality of service of the transit bus system around James Madison University (JMU), located in Harrisonburg, Virginia, USA. By utilizing the power of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as Raspberry Pi computing devices, it is possible to create a network of smart nodes that collect data on the bus routing efficiency and ridership. Using the collected data and using big data analysis, improvements can be made to bus route efficiency and traffic congestion in Harrisonburg, as well as similar college towns. This paper presents data analysis for the first deployment of the IoT nodes at seven JMU bus shelters, during the Spring 2017. Data stations compile and submit the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses and timestamps of wireless devices surrounding the bus stations. This information is stored in a Cloud Storage database that allows for big data analysis and convenient access. In this paper we present the usage of the data collected, modifications to improve both the transit system as well as the data collection methods for future node deployments. Our results show the average passenger waiting times at a sample of the seven bus stations. Route optimization and dynamic changes for the route are discussed. Also, we discuss several concerns on security and privacy related to the collection, transmission, and storage of data in the Cloud (e.g., privacy of the ridership MAC addresses, tracking of a specific bus rider in the system...etc.). Additional security implementation has been suggested to emphasize security and privacy protection.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Heterogeneous multi-core platforms that contain different types of cores, organized as clusters, are emerging, e.g., ARM's big.LITTLE architecture. These platforms often need to deal with multiple applications, having different performance requirements, executing concurrently. This leads to the generation of varying and mixed workloads (e.g., compute and memory intensive) due to resource sharing. Run-time management is required for adapting to such performance requirements and workload variabilities and to achieve energy efficiency. Moreover, the management becomes challenging when the applications are multi-threaded and the heterogeneity needs to be exploited. The existing run-time management approaches do not efficiently exploit cores situated in different clusters simultaneously (referred to as inter-cluster exploitation) and DVFS potential of cores, which is the aim of this paper. Such exploitation might help to satisfy the performance requirement while achieving energy savings at the same time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a run-time management approach that first selects thread-to-core mapping based on the performance requirements and resource availability. Then, it applies online adaptation by adjusting the voltage-frequency (V-f) levels to achieve energy optimization, without trading-off application performance. For thread-to-core mapping, offline profiled results are used, which contain performance and energy characteristics of applications when executed on the heterogeneous platform by using different types of cores in various possible combinations. For an application, thread-to-core mapping process defines the number of used cores and their type, which are situated in different clusters. The online adaptation process classifies the inherent workload characteristics of concurrently executing applications, incurring a lower overhead than existing learning-based approaches as demonstrated in this paper. The classification of workload is performed using the metric Memory Reads Per Instruction (MRPI). The adaptation process pro-actively selects an appropriate V-f pair for a predicted workload. Subsequently, it monitors the workload prediction error and performance loss, quantified by instructions per second (IPS), and adjusts the chosen V-f to compensate. We validate the proposed run-time management approach on a hardware platform, the Odroid-XU3, with various combinations of multi-threaded applications from PARSEC and SPLASH benchmarks. Results show an average improvement in energy efficiency up to 33 percent compared to existing approaches while meeting the performance requirements.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - Since the first robot manipulator for industrial applications was installed for General Motors, the planning and execution of its movements has been an important part in the development of robotic systems involving researchers from different specialties. The planning and guidance of the movement in the robots has been increasingly complex due to the wide variety of applications in which they are used, from repetitive tasks in the traditional assembly lines to the assistance in the movements of very precise surgical operations which require real-time movement guidance, this has established an area of research and technological development known as 'Robotics hardware and software driving'. The article shows the implementation of the methodology called 'Boundary Object Function BOF' [Pena 2005], algorithm for recognition and location of rigid forms, in an embedded electronic device of the RaspBerry Pi type 3. In the method used, the electronic system acquires and condition the image, to be converted to a binary image used by the BOF algorithm. Experimental results within a manufacturing cell were performed with the implementation of the method. The result of the integration of recognition algorithms and location of rigid manufacturing parts in embedded electronic systems, shows the possibility of using them in manufacturing applications with processing high speed requirements and concurrent processes, in this way, a robot learns online and identify objects that are familiar to the performed tasks. The technological proposal presented for the invariant recognition of objects based on the BOF algorithm implemented in an electronic embedded system calculates the contour of rigid pieces very quickly.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - We propose POWERALERT, an efficient external integrity checker for untrusted hosts. Current attestation systems suffer from shortcomings, including requiring a complete checksum of the code segment, from being static, use of timing information sourced from the untrusted machine, or using imprecise timing information such as network round-trip time. We address those shortcomings by (1) using power measurements from the host to ensure that the checking code is executed and (2) checking a subset of the kernel space over an extended period. We compare the power measurement against a learned power model of the execution of the machine and validate that the execution was not tampered. Finally, POWERALERT randomizes the integrity checking program to prevent the attacker from adapting. We model the interaction between POWERALERT and an attacker as a time-continuous game. The Nash equilibrium strategy of the game shows that POWERALERT has two optimal strategy choices: (1) aggressive checking that forces the attacker into hiding, or (2) slow checking that minimizes cost. We implement a prototype of POWERALERT using Raspberry Pi and evaluate the performance of the integrity checking program generation.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Natural disasters are one of the things that cannot be predicted. Natural disasters can cause losses, both assets and objects can even take lives. To reduce the number of losses, rapid evacuation handling from the Search and Rescue (SAR) team is needed to help victims of natural disasters. But in fact, there are often obstacles in the evacuation process. Such obstacles are such as bad weather conditions, disconnection of telecommunications networks, difficulty access to the victims of natural disasters and the spread of SAR teams that are not evenly distributed throughout the disaster area. Convolutional Neural Network is one of the developments of Artificial Neural Networks for image classification, image segmentation, and object recognition with high accuracy and high performance. CNN can learn to detect various images according to images from the dataset studied. So, this paper designed a system for detecting victims of natural disasters using the CNN method and implemented it on a raspberry pi which can detect victims of natural disasters through streaming cameras placed on UAVs. In this paper, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method with 100% accuracy with distance object 1-4 m uses the Mobile-net SSD model.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Aggregator oblivious encryption was proposed by Shi et al. (NDSS 2011). In this method, an aggregator can compute an aggregated sum of data and is unable to learn anything else (aggregator obliviousness). Since the aggregator does not learn individual data that may reveal users' habits and behaviors, several applications including privacy-preserving smart metering have been considered. In this paper, we propose an aggregator oblivious encryption scheme with public verifiability where the aggregator is required to generate a proof of an aggregated sum, and anyone can verify whether the aggregated sum has been correctly computed by the aggregator. Although Leontiadis et al. (CANS 2015) considered verifiability, their scheme requires an interactive complexity assumption to provide the unforgeability of the proof. Our scheme is proven to be unforgeable under a static and simple assumption (a variant of the Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption). Moreover, our scheme inherits the tightness of the reduction of the Benhamouda et al. scheme (ACM TISSEC 2016) for proving aggregator obliviousness. This tight reduction allows us to employ elliptic curves of a smaller order and leads to efficient implementation. Specifically, for 112-bit security, we can employ Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curves with a 383-bit prime order, whereas we need to employ curves with a 1031-bit prime order to implement the Leontiadis et al. scheme. We give implementations of two schemes and evaluate their performances under those curves. We employ a Raspberry-Pi as a power-constrained device such as a smart meter. Consequently, we demonstrate that the running time of the data encryption, data aggregation and verification in our scheme are reduced by approximately 74%, 64% and 89%, respectively, compared to those of the Leontiadis et al. scheme.

N2  - "Handwritten characters" are a means of communication with deafblind person. "Handwritten characters" are written by caregivers with fingers on the palm of a deafblind person. "Handwritten characters" have the feature of being easy to learn because a person can recognize hiragana and katakana intuitively. Many deafblind person can communicate using this method. However, because the caregiver must stay by the persons side, it imposes a heavy burden. For this study, we developed a support device that is able to recreate handwritten characters remotely without the assistance of a caregiver. The system consists of a mobile terminal on the input side, a server, and an output device. On the input side, characters are input using a mobile terminal on which a dedicated application is mounted. Applications are supported by Windows OS (Microsoft Corp.) and Android OS (Alphabet Inc.). Users have two modes of inputting characters: keyboard input and writing characters directly one by one. For keyboard input, a user can send more than one character at a time. The server uses Raspberry Pi. When the server receives character data via the network, it transmits character coordinates to the output device based on the data. In addition, a character file that records the coordinates of the character is stored in advance. When writing characters directly, the received data are converted to a format that can be read out by the output device. Then the data are transmitted to the output device. For keyboard input, the sent character strings are decomposed one character at a time. For the decomposed characters, the coordinate data are read out from the character file corresponding to each character and are transmitted to the output device. The output device performs a process of reproducing the handwritten character to the deafblind person. We used software (Makeblock mDrawBot; Makeblock Co., Ltd.) embedded in the device, which performs character output using coordinate data. This output device, which operates based on the coordinate data transmitted from the server, is connected to the server via a wire. Makeblock mDrawbot is plotter software that draws based on X and Y coordinates. We are studying the mechanism of adding Z coordinates so that it can be drawn according to the hand position. Development of this device demonstrated that the input characters were output correctly. Additionally, it reduces the labor of writing directly. This device can reduce burdens on caregivers.  2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM

N2  - In this presentation, we introduce a novel software defined radio (SDR) universal wireless platform, xRadio, for fast prototyping of various emerging wireless systems featuring with attracting cost performance ratio when compared to current solutions. xRadio realizes its advancement and integrity based on a compact and right-on-target design strategy, through adopting a cost efficient raspberry PI minicomputer and a field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip from Altera as its core processors. Function modules can be easily realized through C/C++ and/or python program in a Linux environment or programmable logical elements (LEs) of FPGA achieving powerful computation. To evaluate its performance, an onboard unit (OBU) for vehicle-to-vehicle communications based on both long term evolution (LTE) and dedicate short range communications (DSRC) systems is being built up. Corresponding systems design and key performances are tested and validated including bit error rate (BER) to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and processing latency, which validates the usability of xRadio. The unprecedented price-to-performance ratio of xRadio has potential to be applied in a broad range of applications ranging from engineering, production and educations.

N2  - Lightweight cryptography offers energy-efficient cryptographic capabilities on low powered devices such as those commonly found in the Internet of Things (IoT). One such lightweight scheme is the AA-Beta (AAc) asymmetric cryptographic scheme which is based on the Diophantine Equation Hard Problem (DEHP) and whose algorithm consists of only basic arithmetic operations of addition and subtraction for both the encryption and decryption process. In a previous work we have shown that the implementation of the AAc scheme on a Raspberry-Pi (embedded) platform produced a remarkable timing improvement for the encryption and decryption of messages when compared to previous trials on a numeric computing environment. In this paper, we present the energy analysis of running the AAc scheme over Raspbian OS on the Raspberry Pi 2 device. We compare the energy consumptions for encryption and decryption using the AAc scheme with similar processes using the Textbook Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman (RSA) scheme on the aforesaid platform. The AAc asymmetric encryption process demonstrates a significantly lower energy consumption compared to RSA, whereby as much as 400 times less energy was used by AAc when encrypting messages while considerable energy savings were also seen during AAc message decryption. We conclude that the AAc encryption scheme is a cryptographic scheme with a great potential for deployment on low powered devices, offering fast and energy-efficient asymmetric cryptographic capabilities to all devices.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - High latency in an interactive system limits its usability. In order to reduce end-to-end latency of such systems, it is necessary to analyze and optimize the latency of individual contributors, such as input devices, applications, or displays. We present a simple tool for measuring the latency of USB-connected input devices with sub-millisecond accuracy. The tool, based on a Raspberry Pi 2 microcomputer, repeatedly toggles a button of a game controller, mouse, or keyboard via an optocoupler soldered to the button and measures the time until the input event arrives. This helps researchers, developers and users to identify and characterize sources of input lag. An initial comparison of multiple input devices shows differences not only in average latency but also in its variance.  2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - A quadrotor Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) is designed to navigate a track using neural network approach to identify the direction of the path from a stream of monocular images received from a downward-facing camera mounted on the vehicle. Current autonomous MAVs mainly employ computer vision techniques based on image processing and feature tracking for vision-based navigation tasks. It requires expensive onboard computation and can create latency in the real-time system when working with low-powered computers. By using a supervised image classifier, we shift the costly computational task of training a neural network to classify the direction of the track to an off-board computer. We make use of the learned weights obtained after training to perform simple mathematical operations to predict the class of the image on the onboard computer. We compare the computer vision based tracking approach with the proposed approach to navigate a track using a quadrotor and show that the processing rates of the latter is faster. This allows low-cost, low-powered computers such as the Raspberry Pi to be used efficiently as onboard companion computers for flying vision-based autonomous missions with MAVs.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - This paper develops an Internet-of-Things data highway embracing end sensors, sensor nodes, databases, big data processors, web connections, and high-end statistics engines. It is aiming at automatic, pseudo real-time, and integrative sensor stream processing, fully benefitting from the capability of sophisticated statistics packages supporting a variety of artificial intelligence and data mining libraries. Specifically, Raspberry Pi nodes capture signals from attached sensors via GPIO interfaces and insert into a remote MySQL database table using its connector utility. In the Linux machine, the table entry is purged at each fixed time and dumped to a text file for a later batch analysis using Hadoop. The R package running in a Windows PC periodically downloads the sensor stream from the database table via the implementation of a library extension invoking relevant operating systems calls. In the R space, even a spatial analysis and visualization can be provided comprehensively.  2016 ACM.

N2  - This paper presents location-aware speakers for the immersive virtual reality environments as well as conventional surround sound systems. The surround sound system generally requires multiple speakers fixed in specific positions and connected to dedicated audio jack holes. In this paper, we propose wireless speakers that can aware their locations and dedicated sound channels without troublesome installations. The proposed speakers use the Internet of things devices by combining a Raspberry Pi and a beacon to each speaker, which enable smart and connected applications. Each speaker estimates distances to other speakers from received signal strength indication of beacons with bluetooth low energy signals. By analyzing the relative distances between speakers, we detect the speaker locations in various speaker setups. We experimented our method with three sound system formats in various sizes and analyzed the accuracy of the location detection.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - This paper proposes a novel method of UDP multi-pathization with SDN for NFS. Although current UDP protocol, which is one of the transport layer protocol of NFS, cannot handle multiple paths simultaneously, the proposed method can multi-pathize UDP by utilizing SDN without any changes of current TCP/IP protocols. The method distributes packets over multiple paths according to the congestion of the paths and the length of IP packets. Since the control is performed on SDN, no changes of existing protocols, softwares, and devices are required. The authors implemented their method by using OpenFlow and IoT devices, Raspberry Pi 3 as SDN protocols and IoT devices, respectively; they then confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method by actual experiments.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology enables the flexibility of a programmable hardware platform for radio applications. A wideband SDR can be programmed to function with various radio systems: FM radio, GSM (2G), 3G or WiFi systems. In this paper, the BladeRF SDR with the frequency range of 300 MHz-3.8 GHz and full-duplex transmission capability will be set up as a GSM BTS (base transceiver station). The BladeRF is working with the YateBTS software for the BTS operation. Raspberry Pi is utilized as the processor to provide further portability. A GSM repeater that is connected to the BladeRF was used to amplify the signal up to 41 dB, and can increase the coverage range to about 70 m. Although the reliability of voice and SMS communication is only about 50% and 85% respectively, the BladeRF can still provide an ad-hoc alternative communication system in time of emergency or in remote areas.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - When a disaster occurs, early evacuation of residents is one of the effective ways for reduction of human damage. Then, the rapid collection and delivery of accurate disaster-related information are essential. With this background, the authors' research group is focusing on how Twitter is utilized at the time of disasters. For example, we have researched the implementation of disaster-related information sharing systems that utilize Twitter. However, since these systems require users to send disaster situations manually, it is difficult to collect the situation in the disaster area comprehensively. By the way, recent commercial trucks are equipped with a communication function, which makes it possible to grasp movement history and failure status in real-time. Then, there are studies on obtaining the image of the car-mounted camera automatically in real-time for grasping the road condition. It is thought that the image taken by the car-mounted camera is useful not only for understanding the road condition but also for visualizing the conditions in the disaster-affected area. Moreover, it is considered that trucks travel in a wider area than passenger cars. Therefore, in this study, we propose an automatic situation visualization system of a disaster area and implement the prototype of it. The system collects and visualizes images taken by the car-mounted camera of a truck running in areas where a disaster occurs, or an occurrence of a disaster is predicted. The proposed system makes it possible to grasp the situation in the target area quickly and comprehensively. In this study, we implement a prototype of the proposed system by using a single-board computer, Raspberry Pi, a web camera, and a GPS module. The system gets longitude and latitude information at regular intervals by using the GPS module. If it is determined that the truck equipped with the system is in the area where a weather warning, such as the heavy rain warning, is issued, sending an image taken by the camera of the system starts. The images sent from trucks are stored in a database with longitude and latitude information and shooting time. We moreover implement a visualize system which shows the images stored in the database on the Web map.  2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: "Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future".

N2  - In this paper, we propose system based on impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar sensors for counting multiple people passing through a passage or a wide door. The proposed counting system utilizes two IR-UWB radar sensors equipped with antennas which have narrow beam width to form two invisible electronic layers in the path. The two electronic layers are used for sensing and direction recognition of multiple people passing by. Algorithmically, sensing and direction recognition of a person passing through a path are performed considering both information of a received signal in each radar and mutual information between two radar signals. The proposed counting system is implemented with two radar modules designed using commercial radar ICs and a Raspberry Pi 2 module. We installed the designed modules in the subway station to verify the performance. Based on the installed modules, data were acquired for one week and the counting performance was verified for various time intervals, such as 2 min, 1 h, and 1 day. Except for a few cases, we could get counting results with errors less than 10%.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents the implementation of traffic sign detection on a low cost embedded system. The proposed system consists of color thresholding, shape detection, and sign validation. An efficient color thresholding based on the red-blue angle color transformation (RBAT) and the normalized red color is employed to extract the red circular traffic sign in an image. Then an ellipse fitting technique is applied to detecting the circular sign. Further, a novel technique to validate the circular sign is proposed by employing the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) which is calculated on the outer area of the sign. The experimental results show that the true positive rate of 0.92 and the precision of 0.97 could be achieved. The execution time of the proposed algorithm which is implemented on a Raspberry Pi Type 3 module is 48.17 ms. It provides a promising result for the real-time implementation.  2018 ICIC International.

N2  - Human beings have a natural ability to see, listen and interact with their external environment. Unfortunately, there are some people who are differently abled and do not have the ability to use their senses to the best extent possible. Such people depend on other means of communication like sign language. This presents a major roadblock for people in the deaf and dumb communities when they try to engage in interaction with others, especially in their educational, social and professional environments. Therefore, it is necessary to have an advance gesture recognition or sign language detection system to bridge this communication gap. Here an effort has been made to develop a smart glove using Intel Galileo Gen 2 loT kit for real-Time gesture recognition. The objective is to create a device which helps the hearing or speech impaired persons to communicate with others.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Detecting smoke from visual sensors is crucial for fire warnings. However, visually detecting smoke is still challenging because the chrominance, shape, transparency, texture, motion, and so on, of smoke vary over a wide range. A deep neural network (DNN) could detect smoke with higher accuracy, but the models are too large to run on limited resource platforms. To make the models smaller and improve the accuracy, three novel strategies are proposed in this paper: 1) feed the networks with blocks rather than the original image; 2) feed the network with condensed data rather than videos to extract dynamic characteristics; and 3) the framework has two stages, the first stage focuses on every block to find thin smoke, and the second stage focuses on the ascending and expanding motions in videos. It is not an end-to-end network, and every subnetwork works on a small matrix, even the one at the second stage, which operates on the whole image. Therefore, the network based on these strategies, the slight smoke perceptual network (SSPN), is small enough to be integrated on a raspberry pi. The experiments demonstrate that SSPN outperforms existing traditional methods and the methods based on DNN and achieves the highest accuracy and the highest sensitivity.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - Due to the uncommon and unpredictable phenomenon, lightning event become one of the challenging research topics for the scientist. The main thing that most capturing their attention is the lightning detection method which can improve the public safety by pinpointing the location of the lightning event and sending out the warning notification. Currently, there are lots of researcher proceed with the study related with the relationship between the pattern of the lightning and the electromagnetic signal received. During the research process, they would like to capture a clear lightning image from the cloud to proceed with the study of characteristic of the pattern of the lightning and electromagnetic field. The most common method for the researcher to detect and capture the lightning image is using the high-speed camera with a flash sensor. But this method is extremely expensive and has its own limitation on mobility part. Therefore, this paper is to develop and evaluate the suitable algorithm and programming language onto Raspberry Pi platform and act as an upgraded choice to replace high speed camera with affordable cost, high mobility but less accuracy compares to high speed camera.  2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - A wireless sensor network (WSN) has achieved significant importance in tracking different physical or environmental conditions using wireless sensor nodes. Such types of networks are used in various applications including smart cities, smart building, military target tracking and surveillance, natural disaster relief, and smart homes. However, the limited power capacity of sensor nodes is considered a major issue that hampers the performance of a WSN. A plethora of research has been conducted to reduce the energy consumption of sensor nodes in traditional WSN, however the limited functional capability of such networks is the main constraint in designing sophisticated and dynamic solutions. Given this, software defined networking (SDN) has revolutionized traditional networks by providing a programmable and flexible framework. Therefore, SDN concepts can be utilized in designing energy-efficient WSN solutions. In this paper, we exploit SDN capabilities to conserve energy consumption in a traditional WSN. To achieve this, an energy-aware multihop routing protocol (named EASDN) is proposed for software defined wireless sensor network (SDWSN). The proposed protocol is evaluated in a real environment. For this purpose, a test bed is developed using Raspberry Pi. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits promising results in terms of network lifetime, average energy consumption, the packet delivery ratio, and average delay in comparison to an existing energy efficient routing protocol for SDWSN and a traditional source routing algorithm.  2019 by the authors.

N2  - Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication is the leading technology for realising the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The M2M sensor nodes are characterized by low-power and low-data rates devices which have increased exponentially over the years. IPv6 over low power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN) is the first protocol that provides IPv6 connectivity to the wireless M2M sensor nodes. Having a tremendous number of M2M sensor nodes execute independent control decision leads to difficulty in network control and management. In addition, these evergrowing devices generate massive traffic and cause energy scarcity, which affects the M2M sensor node lifetime. Recently, software defined-networking (SDN) and network functioning virtualization (NFV) are being used in M2M sensor networks to add programmability and flexibility features in order to adopt the exponential increment in wireless M2M traffic and enable network configuration even after deployment. This paper presents a proof-of-concept implementation which aims to analyze how SDN, NFV, and cloud computing can interact together in the 6LoWPAN gateway to provide simplicity and flexibility in network management. The proposed approach is called customized software defined-NFV (SD-NFV), and has been tested and verified by implementing a real-time 6LoWPAN testbed. The experimental results indicated that the SD-NFV approach reduced the network discovery time by 60% and extended the node's lifetime by 65% in comparison to the traditional 6LoWPAN network. The implemented testbed has one sink which is the M2M 6LoWPAN gateway where the network coordinator and the SDN controller are executed. There are many possible ways to implement 6LoWPAN testbed but limited are based on open standards development boards (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Beagle Bones). In the current testbed, the Arduino board is chosen and the SDN controller is customized and written using C++ language to fit the 6LoWPAN network requirements. Finally, SDN and NFV have been envisioned as the most promising techniques to improve network programmability, simplicity, and management in cloud-based 6LoWPAN gateway.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - Traffic plays an important role in social stability and community development. Without an appropriate traffic signal control system, the possibility of traffic congestion will be very high and causes various negative impacts. The traffic signal control system with video camera sensor is implemented in embedded systems using BeagleBoard-xM. The system uses Viola-Jones method and Haar Training in detecting the vehicle object from a video frame. Then, Euclidean distance and kalman filter methods are used in tracking the vehicle. The ability of kalman filter in predicting the next position of the object is a very important feature for multi-object tracking. The number of counted vehicles in each lane at the intersection then will be processed using Fuzzy Logic to determine optimal cycle time and split time.  2011 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, we propose an ID-based linear homomorphic cryptosystem, which consisted of an ID-based encryption scheme with homomorphic property and a linearly homomorphic signature scheme, where the linearly homomorphic signature scheme is compatible with the privacy-protection data aggregation. Then, we propose a secure and efficient ID-based meter report protocol for the isolated smart grid devices, which can not only protect against unauthorized reading, unintentional errors and maliciously altering messages, but also achieve privacy-preserving for the customers. We provide security analysis of our protocol in context of five typical attacks. The implementation of our protocol on the Intel Edison Platform shows that our protocol is efficient enough for the physical constrained devices, like smart grid devices.

N2  - Imaging has become an essential tool in modern medicine science. Numerous powerful platforms to register, store, analyze and process medical imaging applications appear in recent years. In this article, we have designed an advanced visual processing system (ViPS) that stores and processes complex and multi-dimensional medical imaging application. The ViPS provides a user-friendly programming environment and high-performance architecture for data acquisition, registration, storage, analysis and performs segmentation, filtering, and recognition of complex real-time complex and multidimensional medical images or videos. The proposed architecture is highly reliable concerning cost, performance, and power. ViPS is designed and evaluated on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA VC707 Evaluation Kit. The performance of ViPS is compared with the Heterogeneous Multi-Processing Odroid XU3 board and GPU Jetson TK1 Embedded Development Kit with 192 CUDA cores based graphic systems. In comparison to the Heterogeneous Multi-core and GPU based Graphics systems, the results show that ViPS improves 2.4 and 1.4 times system performance respectively, for iridology application. While executing real-time complex images reconstruction at 2 and 1.25 of higher frame rate, the ViPS achieves 15.2 and 5.26 of performance improvement while running various image processing algorithms. The ViPS gets 3.01 and 1.13 of speedup for video processing algorithms and draws 1.55 and 2.27 times less dynamic power.  2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - New prospects for health care monitoring is engendered by the augmentation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Big data, as well as the ubiquitous nature of tiny wearable bio sensors. Many confront have yet to be addressed to create a dependable and flexible system for health care monitoring. In this paper Big data analytics on IoT based Health care system is proposed. IoT based health care monitoring system comprises of 'Internet of health sensor things'. These things produce huge volumes of data that could not be handled by the physician. The Physicians important concern is that they need to make critical decisions about their patient's health from these huge volumes of health information. He/she has to segregate the information about one particular patient from the flood of health care information arriving from the massive number of patients. Intel Galileo Gen 2 is acting as IoT agent in this paper and is used to deploy the health information of patients into the Cloud. The Cloud could manage the increasing volume of health data, resourcefully share the information across healthcare systems and provide viability for Big data analytics. Real time alerting of patient health information is an important exercise in Big data which is crucial in the proposed work. The Big health sensor data are analyzed using the Hadoop framework. Since the response time of the proposed system is less, it is suitable for real time alerting.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) has long been recognized as a public health concern amongst children, where its symptoms include impulsiveness, inattentiveness and unfocused. The consequence is children with poor academic performance and discipline that has negative impact on their future. Current treatment for ADD uses powerful psycho-stimulant drugs, to reduce aggression and enhance concentration. However, there are always risk factors and adverse effects with these drugs. Moreover, drugs do not alter the dysfunctional condition. Forefront research in biomedical engineering unveils neurofeedback, which presents an exciting alternative approach to neural related disorders. Our ultimate goal is to develop a neurofeedback system to enable anyone with attention deficit to practice regulating their brain to reach an attentive state of mind, with reduced dependency on drug related intervention. Relying on neuroplasticity, neurofeedback focuses on the training of brain through activities to circumvent the dysfunctional condition. In this paper, such a system has been developed and applied on normal healthy subjects, to establish the protocol on EEG subband and electrode placement as well as system functional testing. It consists of a wireless EEG acquisition module, a feature extraction module, an IoT database module, an Intel Edison microcontroller board and a feedback activity center, the humanoid robot. The protocol on subband and electrode placement is established with short time Fourier transform (STFT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT). The system rewards the subject if the root mean square voltage of his beta subband at Fp1 exceeds the target voltage, when he is attentive.  Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

N2  - An energy-efficient biosignal processing (BSP) system with a silent mirror tracer is proposed for long-term activity monitoring in battery-operated wearable devices. We implemented our approach using the PRUDAQ analog front stacked on the BeagleBone base station. A low-power highspeed sampler in PRUDAQ is directly integrated with the digital signal processing (DSP) unit in BeagleBone to reduce the communication overhead on connecting to any cloud-side host computer. The BSP on-chip timer-driven hardware directly drives the PRUDAQ sampler without CPU activation and silently traces samples into a mirrored buffer. The proposed method could significantly reduce the number of temporary pauses by running the interrupt service routines and frequent buffer flush to swap traced samples betweeen the host computer. The proposed BSP system results in a 15% reduction of total energy consumption by silently tracing incoming samples in case of extracting features from the 20 million samples for long-term activity monitoring applications such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Most traffic accidents are caused by negligence of the driver in managing rest time when driving; driver was sleepy and so could not control the vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to have a device that can detect sleepiness and warn the driver beforehand so that the driver can avoid the accident. The development of this drowsiness detection system is using the heartbeat as a source of data to be retrieved using Photoplethysmography sensor. The system then classifies and determines the drowsiness level of the driver based on his/her heartbeat. This system uses Arduino Nano and Odroid XU4 as the processing unit and has LCD to display the output. The developed system has the success rate up to 96.52%. From this work, it has been proven that a person's sleep condition will affect the heart rate.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Modern embedded systems execute multiple applications, both sequentially and concurrently, on heterogeneous platforms. Determining the most energy-efficient system configuration (i.e. the number of parallel threads, their core allocations and operating frequencies) tailored for each kind of workload is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel runtime optimization approach with the aim of maximizing power-normalized performance considering dynamic workload variations. To reduce overhead and complexity, we adopt a model-free approach to runtime adaptation based on workload classification. This classification is supported by analysis of data collected from a comprehensive study investigating the tradeoffs between inter-application concurrency with performance and power under different system configurations. We conduct extensive experiments on an Odroid XU3 heterogeneous platform with synthetic and standard benchmark applications to develop the control policies and validate our approach. These experiments show that workload classification into CPU-intensive and memory-intensive types provides the foundation for scalable energy minimization with low complexity. Implementing this approach as a Linux runtime governor, we demonstrate that IPS/Watt can be improved by over 120% compared to existing approaches.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Pedestrian detection (PD) is an important application domain in computer vision and pattern recognition. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become a major field of research in recent years. In this paper, an algorithm for a robust pedestrian detection method based on the combination of the infrared HOG (IR-HOG) feature and SVM is proposed for highly complex outdoor scenarios on the basis of airborne IR image sequences from UAV. The basic flow of our application operation is as follows. Firstly, the thermal infrared imager (TAU2-336), which was installed on our Outdoor Autonomous Searching (OAS) UAV, is used for taking pictures of the designated outdoor area. Secondly, image sequences collecting and processing were accomplished by using high-performance embedded system with Samsung ODROID-XU4 and Ubuntu as the core and operating system respectively, and IR-HOG features were extracted. Finally, the SVM is used to train the pedestrian classifier. Experiment show that, our method shows promising results under complex conditions including strong noise corruption, partial occlusion etc.  2018 SPIE.

N2  - The evolution of embedded systems and their applications in every daily activity, derive the development of lightweight cryptography. Widely used crypto-libraries are too large to fit on constrained devices, like sensor nodes. Also, such libraries provide redundant functionality as each lightweight and ultra-lightweight application utilizes a limited and specific set of crypto-primitives and protocols. In this paper we present the ULCL crypto-library for embedded systems. It is a compact software cryptographic library, optimized for space and performance. The library is a collection of open source ciphers (27 overall primitives). We implement a common lightweight API for utilizing all primitives and a user-friendly API for users that aren't familiar with cryptographic applications. One of the main novelties is the configurable compilation process. A user can compile the exact set of crypto-primitives that are required to implement a lightweight application. The library is implemented in C and measurements were made on PC, BeagleBone and MemSic IRIS devices. ULCL occupies 4 - 516.7KB of code. We compare our library with other similar proposals and their suitability in different types of embedded devices.
