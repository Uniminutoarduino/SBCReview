N2  - For Taiwan, in order to improve the productivity and quality of agriculture, it is necessary to become automatic management. This paper uses a humidity sensor, a temperature sensor, a carbon dioxide sensor and a Wi-Fi module to design a wireless agricultural monitoring system based on the architecture of the Internet of things. And can also control the equipment between the fields at the far end. In this paper, we use ESP8266 to design the Wi-Fi module and set up a wireless sensor (control) system, and use TCP / UDP to establish remote control and sensor data collection functions. The data will be transmitted to a packet analysis set up by the Raspberry Pi, and the data will be stored in the database developed by Microsoft (MSSQL), and finally the user interface is built using the web page developed by ASP.NET. Users can instantly monitor the condition of farmland by platform. For example, soil temperature, humidity, or sunshine intensity. It can also directly control remote farm equipment directly, such as watering or opening the sun visor. The wireless monitoring system can effectively improve the efficiency of management.  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) means learning and interacting with millions of things including services, sensors, actuators, and many other objects on the Internet. This project enhances on how far IoT can connect devices on different platforms. This will effortlessly help humans in various fields like Home automation, networking, data monitoring and others. The evolution of human-machine user interface has drastically changed over the years. The path of advancement has been through keyboard, mouse, touch and now it is Voice. This new user interface can be achieved by Alexa Voice Service. Currently, we have very few devices that can be controlled using Alexa. Some of the examples are Philips Hue, WeMo, and Wink. But these are limited to certain hardware. The initial installation and maintenance is expensive. The proposed system connects and controls most of the IoT devices connected to it using Voice. As the number of devices on the cloud increase, there is need for updating firmware more frequently. This is tedious. It involves taking out the installed devices, changing the code and flashing it again. To overcome these, processing of data and response can be done elsewhere. Node-Red, a visual wiring tool helps in connecting devices with ease resulting in effortless and rapid connection setups.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - This Research to Practice full paper presents a framework for abductive computational modeling. Abduction is a type of reasoning which starts with observed facts then seeks to find hypotheses to explain the facts. This type of reasoning is fundamental for engineers to solve many problems, including design, planning, and fault diagnosis. Computational modeling is the process of programming models of machines, circuits, buildings, and phenomena in general. Abductive Computational Modeling refers to development of programs to make abductive reasoning about devices, techniques, and phenomena that are commonly studied, for example, in the curricula of engineering courses. As an educational activity, modeling belongs to the class known as constructivism, which students learn through activities of developing models and critically analyzing the developed model. Although computational modeling has been extensively investigated - since Papert's seminal studies in the 1960s about the use of the LOGO language, until the present day, demarcated by modeling with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and languages like C, Scratch, and Python - there is little study on abductive computational modeling. This work proposes and experimentally investigates the use of a framework for abductive computational modeling named AbCM. The results suggest the feasibility of the framework and indicate important challenges to be overcome.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - As the discipline of K-12 computer science (CS) education evolves, international comparisons of curriculum and teaching provide valuable information for policymakers and educators. Previous academic analyses of K-12 CS intended and enacted curriculum has been conducted via curriculum analyses, country reports, experience reports, and case studies, with K-12 CS comparisons distinctly lacking teacher input. This report presents the process of an international Working Group to develop, pilot, review and test validity and reliability of the MEasuring TeacheR Enacted Computing Curriculum (METRECC) instrument to survey teachers in K-12 schools about their implementation of CS curriculum to understand pedagogy, practice, resources and experiences in classrooms around the world. The Working Group reviewed and analysed pilot data from 244 teachers across seven countries (Australia, England, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Scotland and the United States).We analysed the pilot results (n=244) and applied four validity tests: face validity, concurrent validity, population validity, sampling validity and construct validity, in addition to a focus group to further revised the instrument. This report presents the pilot results and outcomes of validity testing, as well as revisions made to the instrument. The resulting METRECC tool combines a country report template and a teacher survey that will provide K-12 teachers with a means to communicate their experience enacting CS curriculum. National and regional policymakers can use METRECC data to inform iterative curriculum revision and implementation. We provide open access to the METRECC instrument and data set.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The study of robotics is often an excellent recruitment motivation for students entering a computing curriculum. It is also often cited that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related robotics is a critical area of future innovation in computing. However, there are a number of challenges to implementing a robotic curriculum at the university level. A few of those challenges include, lack of a uniform hardware platform, incongruity in the software used, and the missing significant deliverable artifacts by students at the end of a term to encourage learning and further interest. Educational robotic activities are often treated as advanced research topics with high associated costs that prohibit widespread integration into the curriculum. In this paper, we present the deployment of a multi-stage robotic platform that attempts to address these challenges and overcome the obstacles. We detail the evolution of the hardware from using a readily available LEGO Mindstorm base platform to next include the addition of an Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Likewise, we detail the transition from the basic LEGO Mindstorm software to the use of leJOS and PYTHON. At each stage, additional sensors and software libraries can likewise be added. Finally, we present an achievable academic goal for students to use the hardware and software platforms to develop a model autonomous vehicle with aspects of intelligent control, learning and adaptive behaviour. All levels of projects can be undertaken at the appropriate level of maturity for the students in the computing curriculum.  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - Mobility being a prime desire of mankind, the effort and resources plunged into the development of safe, efficient, low-cost and easily controllable vehicles has always remained at its peak. Several advancements have been brought about in the field, yet several challenges still exist while one major challenge is achieving robustness at a low computational footprint so as to reduce the power requirements and negate the need for heavy GPUs and other system pre-requisites. This research puts forth an application of Feynman Machine, a hierarchical temporal memory based cortical learning intelligence model analogous to the mammalian neocortex to learn the images and detect a suitable traversable path for navigation. The online learning ability of the Feynman Machine improves performance with time while negating the need for GPUs during training and prediction. The computation can be carried out in computers as small as a Raspberry Pi having low processor specifications, thereby reducing the power requirements of the model. A Unity based simulation and a Raspberry Pi based prototype were also built to substantiate the proposed idea in this research.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Programming a processor detached from real world is no longer a valid approach in Internet of the Things (IoT) era. Nowadays a processor must interact with sensors and actuators and also with others systems through internet. However, introducing IoT concepts in a didactic and easy way in beginners classes of computer architecture is not an easy task. In this paper we present the architecture of a didactic processor and simulator designed to seamlessly interact with sensors and actuators, intended to introduce IoT concepts in computer architecture and assembly language programming courses. This simulator can be executed on a Raspberry Pi nanocomputer, where it is possible to read and control sensors and actuators connected to the GPIO pins, directly from the code executed by the simulator. Another extension implemented in the simulator is the access to external microcontrollers, such as Arduino and NodeMCU, connected to a computer using Firmata protocol. This access is performed via USB or WiFi connection, and makes feasible to control any device connected to the microcontroller's pins. As far as we know, there is no other educational tool that offers such features, at this architectural level, freely available for use.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents a Computer Aided Control System Design (CACSD) environment completely based on the programming language Python. Students can perform all the control design tasks (modeling, identification, controller design, simulation) in this environment, and at the end, they can automatically generate RT code for targets like a PC or a Raspberry PI with a Linux RT OS. A Python package for control purposes have been developed at the Caltech by Richard Murray, with the aim of integrating the most used functions and methods available in other commercial and non commercial software. Using this package it is possible to design different kinds of controllers for laboratory plants (PID, state-feedback, LQR, including full and reduced order observers). An additional package developed at SUPSI allows representing the full system in a graphical block diagram, similar to xCos or Simulink, and automatically generating code for RT targets. This application offers the most used blocks required for the design of a control system. New blocks can be easily integrated into this SW. This environment has been validated at the SUPSI laboratory on different electromechanical plants: the classical Inverted Pendulum, the Disks and Spring system, the Ball on Plate and the Ball on Wheel plants.  2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The implementation of algorithms by means of signal processors usually lacks a friendly user interface, mainly because of the difficulty involved in their creation and maintenance. One practical solution to this problem, both in education and industry, is the integration of signal processors within embedded systems. This configuration enables a designer to easily implement an interface that does not only allow the visualization of the process, but also admits the possibility of changing parameters in real time.  2003-2012 IEEE.

N2  - The Learning Enhanced Watershed Assessment System (LEWAS) lab is a high-frequency, realtime environmental monitoring lab located on the campus of Virginia Tech. This lab has developed over the course of 9 years from a prototype system used in one class to a real-time environmental monitoring system that has been in used in 21courses across 6 institutions and in 3 countries. Throughout its development, this lab has also hosted an NSF/REU site at Virginia Tech for 8 years. Every year for 10 weeks during the summer 8-11 students, coming from several universities and having various disciplinary backgrounds, join the site. Among them, 1-2 engage in interdisciplinary research work in the LEWAS lab, while others join different research labs across the Virginia Tech campus. As of 2015, 12 REU fellows have been mentored by the faculty advisors and the graduate students (including four authors of this paper) of this lab. In this paper, we will discuss the work of these 12 REU fellows and how their combined contribution aided the development of the present LEWAS lab. In 2007, the first REU student to join the lab developed a simple prototype for a wireless data collection system, aiming to design an on-campus watershed sciences and engineering laboratory. This prototype iteratively evolved with the help of other REU students to the present LEWAS, which has the following four stages: 1) data inputs that consist of environmental instruments including an acoustic Doppler current profiler, a water quality sonde and a weather station each taking measurements every 1-3 min., 2) data processing occurring locally on a Raspberry Pi, 3) data storage on a remote server and 4) data visualization through an Online Watershed Learning System (OWLS) (www.lewas.centers.vt.edu/dataviewer) through which end users access the LEWAS data for research and education. Each REU fellow significantly contributed to the development/maintenance/application of two or more of these stages. The implementation of all four stages was a complex process that required interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, which were obtained not only through graduate mentors representing different disciplines (engineering education, civil  environmental engineering, electrical  computer engineering, computer science and environmental science) but also REU students who were pursuing a range of undergraduate degrees (civil  environmental engineering, computer science, computer engineering, chemical engineering and environmental science). Through research experiences in an interdisciplinary lab, REU fellows were exposed to a wide spectrum of learning and research work, beyond their disciplinary domain. The authors, in turn gained experience mentoring the REU fellows in their research work. The knowledge shared in this paper demonstrates how an interdisciplinary engineering system/lab can be iteratively built as a result of undergraduate research work under graduate mentorship. This study also shows how an REU program can support the development of an engineering lab as well as the research of several masters and PhD students.

N2  - Over the past few years, the "Maker" or "Do It Yourself" movement has produced microcontrollers such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi that provide robust capabilities for sensing, control and communication. These tools are useful for both teaching and research in fields outside of ECE, but require the traditional understanding of basic electrical circuits and programming methodology in order to be effective. This dilemma led to development of a course for non-engineers to allow such technologies to be used effectively. Students participated from a diverse array of fields, including agriculture, animal science, biology, finance, fine arts, physics and statistics. The pedagogical approach used was a combination of traditional short lectures, hands-on small lab projects performed in two-person student teams, and a team-selected special project related to their field of study. Out of a total nine week course duration, proposals for the special project were accepted by the end of week three from the student teams, with project approval based on significance and relevance to their particular field and on project feasibility. Lecture/Lab study topics included use of development tools (Integrated Development Environment) for microcontrollers, the C programming language, basic electrical circuits, use of sensors, calibration of sensor data, control of actuators, and communication with the microcontrollers. Each lecture was combined with a hands-on lab project followed by a quiz a few days later. Small lecture-related labs comprised two thirds of the course lab time, with the remaining third devoted to the special project. Student understanding of the course material was assessed based on successful demonstration of predetermined lab projects, on ability to make prescribed customized changes to each lab, and on the quizzes. Class size was limited to 30 people, and assessment of the lab projects and the special project were carried out by the instructor and two student assistants. Preliminary results indicate that participants have all successfully demonstrated the small projects to date, and that the students have submitted relevant and challenging proposals - now underway - for their special projects.

N2  - In recent years, embedded systems based on microprocessors have progressed significantly. This fact allows to use powerful operating systems and programming languages with a high level of abstraction which facilitates the development of applications. This paper shows a communication system designed to be run on a BeagleBoard, a low-cost device based on the chip OMAP 3530. The developed system allows to manage audio signal and involves the wireless transmission of the signals between devices using the Bluetooth technology and a filtering step based on Wiener methodology that improve the signal-noise ratio. This work represents the starting point for implementing a set of signal processing applications on the BeagleBoard.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - This paper describes the design and implementation of GridTeractions, a scalable framework for teaching and testing advanced distribution automation strategies in smart grids. GridTeractions provides a hardware-software platform to interact with online running simulation of distribution systems. The interactive approach leads to fast learning processes for power systems students. Besides, the detailed modeling and continuous results emulate the real systems' operation. This feature allows realistic feedback for testing and design of future automation strategies. The platform uses network communications with Human-Machine Interfaces developed in microprocessor terminals (Raspberry PI 2) to achieve multi-terminal operation. Systems are modeled with OpenDSS scripts and managed by DSSim-PC in order to run simulations in time series with phase domain results, allowing users to continuously evaluate the electrical variables. This paper includes the architecture description, implementation details and validations based in the IEEE test feeders.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - As computer architecture integrates multiple concepts such as microarchitecture, design, the hardware-software interface, compilers, and operating systems, there is an always increasing need to develop new methods for learning and exploring the field. Parallelism in computer systems is a key focus in computer architecture and some core parallel concepts include Amdahl's law, efficiency, and overhead. While there are a number of ways to examine these topics in traditional lectures and assignments, a unique way is to leverage Python-based programming environments that allow students to independently explore concepts and their governing parameters. This paper presents the highlights of PyCompArch Python module developed using the IPython Notebook environment to help the study of concepts in computer architecture. Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language, but traditionally the language does not play a leading role in the education of computer architecture. IPython Notebooks allow developers to interactively run Python code cells and to construct Python codes that execute on remote servers that eliminate any system requirements of the individual. In this way, the environment supports web-based remote "in the cloud" code development that can be modified during lectures or in homework assignments. The PyCompArch module supports a number of ways to help individuals learn concepts of parallelism related to computer architecture as well as explore experiments in computer performance and control. For example, PyCompArch supports the evaluation of performance of real-world benchmarks such as Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) and dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) in Raspberry Pi systems. Overall, the PyCompArch supports student learning and development of experiments in computer architecture. 2015 ACM.

N2  - Parallel programming is a computing model in which the computations are run on multiple processors simultaneously. In this work, a parallel computing system is implemented through the network connection of a set of Raspberry Pi Cluster 3 boards, using 4 nodes (one master and three slaves) that acts as a single computer with improved processing speed. A Linux based operating system, Raspbian is used in the present work, our purpose is to provide an economical, scalable, powerful, mobile architecture and especially low energy consumption as an alternative to the use of high performance computing to execute Python code distributed from the Jupyter notebook platform. The main contribution of this work is the configuration of the cluster to be able to execute some learning machines.  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Today, an increasing number of scientists and engineers are spending more and more of their work hours in front of the computer. Electronic and semiconductor industry are making capable and inexpensive portable consumer devices as evident from smart phones and tablets that are coming out to the market at an accelerated phase. Manufactures have made attempts to launch hobby industries around inexpensive electronics, particularly processor boards, with more capabilities and easy to program systems such as Raspberry Pi. For individual developer or capable consumer those devices offer customization to a level that was never seen before. However, such customizations require development of computer programs to control the devices and data streams. When electrical and computer engineers are trained, it is becoming more imperative that nearly all acquire some level of computer programming skills to effectively function as engineers in their careers. The nature of work performed in industry changes as they progress in careers. Lack of programming ability and experience may challenge their opportunities for technical and even managerial advancements. For example, a senior engineer without programming experience would not become a project manager if that project requires a significant amount of software to be developed in house. At this university, electrical engineering technology (EET) and computer engineering technology (CET) majors always take one semester course on computer programming so they can be effective in using embedded controllers and other programmable devices, later in their curricula or in industry after graduation. It is a C based programming course with few projects appropriate for second year engineering technology students. CET majors further study Java, Ada, and C flavored languages in their curricula. EET majors do not have opportunity to learn other languages although some of them would program - using proprietary languages-Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) after graduation in industrial settings. Several of follow on courses taken by both majors require them to use MATLAB as a problem solving tool in advanced circuit theory and control systems theory courses. Several years ago at this university, students had been learning basic MATLAB on their own, and then learned advance features such as control and signal processing toolboxes with help from instructors in follow-on courses. Instructors in the upper level classes could only make limited efforts to help students learn MATLAB. Their efforts are geared toward actual subject contents which are heavy in abstract concepts and mathematics. The author introduced MATLAB in C programming course in the fall of 2012 with the intent of reducing the future burden of learning its basics on their own. That experience has already been published3by the author. This paper discusses the continuing experience in having MATLAB as an additional programming tool to sophomore level students who are learning programming in C language as their main objective. They still learn advanced concepts and toolboxes in higher level courses. An additional benefit expected and clearly seen over the years is that MATLAB reinforces concepts taught in C such as loops, indexing, conditionals, input/outputs, storage and file management, data and program structures, etc. Also, learning it at this stage to create animation programs provides incentives and variety to further practice algorithm development and problem solving skills. Practice of such skills is essential to become competent programmers. In addition to the findings already discussed in the previous paper, this paper presents survey results from students in several follow-on courses after they have taken this basic C course with piggybacked MATLAB content. The conclusion provides feedback from students as they progress through follow on courses clarifying the cost-benefit of the enhancements done to the basic C programming course a few years back.

N2  - We present Raabta, a video conferencing system for the developing world, which is designed specifically to cater to the technological, social, and economic condition of its target audience. Specifically, to minimize the cost and the energy footprint of the system, it uses the existing analog cable TV network as a communication substrate to connect Raspberry Pi end-hosts. The network stack is designed to operate over a largely unmodified broadcast-based coaxial network. The architecture is completely decentralized and can scale to hundreds of concurrent connections without requiring any backbone connectivity. To make smart use of the existing bandwidth, the video conferencing application uses multi-layered encoding and dynamically switches between selective retransmission and forward error correction based on the loss rate. Finally, the text-free user interface is simple enough to be used by low-literate users. To enable wider Internet connectivity, the architecture can easily be augmented using existing backbone technologies. While designed for direct communication between individuals, we also discuss how the same system can be used to enable community-based telemedicine and distance learning, among other applications.

N2  - Reliable detection and recognition of facial expression from still images in the unconstrained real world situations has many potential applications. Smile detection can be used in many applications include modeling systems for psychological studies on human emotional responses, expression recognition technologies, extending image search capabilities etc. This paper proposes an experimental study of smile detection in embedded environment using Raspberry Pi board, by extracting mouth and eye pair from images using Haar-cascade classifier and train these images using KNN matching algorithm. The relatively simple K- Nearest Neighbor is used because of its lazy learning efficiency. OpenCV- 2.3.1(Open Source Computer Vision) library is used as the imaging library. The experiments explored that the proposed approach has an accuracy of 66.6%  2014 IEEE.

N2  - Off-the-shelf electronic market is large, diverse and easily accessible by many. Credit card size computers (example: Raspberry Pi) or micro-controller boards (example: Arduino) can be used for learning how to code and how to control embedded systems. Nevertheless, there is a lack of off-the-shelf, open source devices that would enable us to learn about and make use of human signal processing. An example of such a device is an electromyograph (EMG). In this paper we investigated, if an EMG device could fulfill the aforementioned gap. EMG device we used for conducting our experiment was a five channel open source EMG Arduino shield. The performance of the device was evaluated on three healthy male subjects. They were instructed to perform basic finger movements which we classified and executed on the robotic hand. The EMG signal classification was performed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. In our experimental setup the average EMG signal classification accuracy was 78.29%. This we believe demonstrates there are EMG devices on the market today that provide access to cost effective prototyping and learning about EMG signals.  2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

N2  - A microgrid (MG) is a cyber-physical system with coupled power and communication networks. The centralized secondary control of MGs with periodical communications restricts system efficiency and resilience. This article proposes a distributed event-triggered secondary control scheme in islanded MGs with its cyber-physical implementation. The proposed control scheme operates with the reduced frequency of communications depending on the MG states change 'events' (e.g., load variations and communication failures). Besides, the secondary control objectives, including frequency/voltage regulation and accurate real/reactive power sharing, are decoupled into two timescales. Instead of designing event-triggering conditions (ETCs) for each secondary control functions, only ETCs for power sharing control in slower timescale are designed. Thus, the communication burden is significantly reduced since communications among neighbor controllers are only needed at the event-triggered time. The proposed controller has been tested on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform, where the physical system is modeled in the OPAL-RT and the cyber system is realized in Raspberry Pis. The control effectiveness is validated by the HIL results.  1972-2012 IEEE.

N2  - In order to improve the working efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV) array inspection system, the application of online monitoring systems for the PV arrays is quickly rising. In this paper, an online PV array monitoring combining with B/S architecture, Python language, and Flask framework is developed to monitor and diagnose the status of PV arrays which can display the data of the PV array and facilitate the staff to monitor the working status of PV array. When a fault occurs, the staff can also register the fault information on the website quickly. The developed system is composed of three parts: data acquisition, data transmission and PV online monitoring website. Firstly, the system uses the Raspberry Pi3 to collect the data when the PV array operates in maximum power point (MPP), and the acquired data is stored locally in the Raspberry Pi. And then, the data is uploaded to the PC side via the FileZilla server software and further transmitted to online monitoring website. Finally, the PV array online monitoring website displays received data, and perform the fault diagnosis of PV array using a kernel based Extreme Learning Machine (KELM). Experimental results show that the total classification accuracy for ten different operating conditions can reach 97.2%.  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - In 2018, the Department for Education in England awarded a contract for over 80 million for a 4-year programme of development of teacher training and student resources in computing. Together with a mandatory curriculum for computing for all children aged 5-16 since 2014, this represents one of the most substantial moves towards educating all children in the discipline of computing in the world. This initiative focuses on supporting and developing teachers in order to establish computing as a core and foundation subject. Such a large-scale and lengthy project has the potential to deepen our understanding of what works in computing education, and there will be much to explore and report on. In this keynote presentation, I will look at research opportunities, and how this project can feed into the global computing education research agenda and contribute to our understanding of what computing for all children means in practice.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - There is growing concern about a cybersecurity skills gap nationwide, as an insufficient number of students are entering this field. Hence, innovative approaches to capacity building are required. We advocate an approach that taps into public awareness and usage of internet-of-things (IoT) devices, which constitute a major source of security vulnerabilities. There is increasing student curiosity about these devices, and a growing tinkering movement. We tap into this zeitgeist by proposing educational courseware to give students hands-on laboratory experience in designing secure embedded systems. Our initial experience at offering this courseware on the Raspberry-Pi computing platform resulted in significant student interest and engagement. We propose building on this momentum by creating further laboratory exercises focused on IoT devices in the medical and healthcare domain. This is a rich domain for security applications due to patient privacy concerns, the need to secure medical devices, and the need to share patient medical records. The newly proposed labs will deploy RFID and barcodes to tag medical devices used in hospitals, sensors to measure patient vitals, biometrics to identify patients, and blockchain to create immutable patient records. These labs can be easily implemented with cheap sensors on the Raspberry-Pi platform, and can be replicated easily. By using this approach, we can build a national talent pool in the area of secure embedded devices. We are in the process of developing these proposed labs. We plan to test them in a classroom setting in Fall 2019. Upon successful testing, we plan to release our labs to interested institutions.  Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

N2  - Most of the current desktop 3D printers are built based on open-source designs from online communities. The largest group of open-source 3D printers is the Self-Replicating Rapid Prototype (RepRap) 3D printers. A RepRap 3D printer needs to connect to a computer or a microprocessor to feed G Code and provide interface for users to control the 3D printer. However, local computer is a relatively expensive solution comparing to the cost of a RepRap 3D printer; while the microprocessor has much less computing capability comparing to a normal computer, and cannot handle computing-intensive jobs like slicing 3D objects or generating G Code. An alternate solution is to use the internet of things (IoT) application to control and monitor 3D printers. IoT is the network of physical devices, vehicles, buildings and other items, allowing objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network. IoT and 3D printing are two important new technologies, which progressively impact a lot of areas of the industries and also our everyday life. Students need to be introduced to these technologies, and get ready for future career opportunities. A multidisciplinary student project is developed to provide students access to both 3D printer and IoT platform, and also learn to collaborate with engineers from other disciplines to solve complex engineering problems. The objective of the project is to design and develop an IoT application to remote monitor the performance of a RepRap 3D printer including the printing progress and the temperatures of the heated bed and hot end. Major tasks involved in the project are: to inspect and upgrade the current 3D printer to avoid any possible compliance issues between the 3D printer and the hardware components or software tools for the IoT application; to connect the 3D printer to the Raspberry Pi microprocessor; and to design and develop the IoT application. The methods and algorithms of connecting a 3D printer to an IoT application is reported, and the IoT application interface and workflow will be presented in the results section. As a pilot study, this project provides first-hand data on the requirements of time and resources to introduce IoT to undergraduate students.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

N2  - This paper presents our experience implementing a newly designed introduction to computing course for first year undergraduate students. The redesigned course focuses on the use of Raspberry Pi microcomputers as a common computing platform in order to encourage student experimentation and fun in a relatively low-cost environment. The course we describe represents a departure at our university from a traditional first-semester introduction to computing which emphasized foundational technical and mathematical skills but less exploration of the field of computing in a more wholistic manner. Our new course focuses on exposure to computing through experimentation. Additionally, it emphasizes community building among the students as well as affording them the opportunity to bring their creativity to bear in a final project showcase. As a result, the course is proving to be attractive not just to traditional computing majors but to a wider swath of the university community. This paper describes the topics selected in the redesign of the course, a summary of the labs involved, a discussion of assignments, and a description of the final project process. We discuss feedback received from students and the overall perception of the course among students and faculty. We also reflect on our experiences from redesigning the course and provide advice for those wishing to adopt a similar introductory course.  2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - SATPRUST is the acronym for Satellite PRototye for Undergraduate STudents, a low-cost project-based experience that is the learning backbone of the capstone courses of the Minor in Fundamentals of Aerospace Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC). This Minor is the first formal undergraduate approach to Astronautics performed at PUC, and since its beginning, the difficult and sometimes "hard-to-apply" concepts in Space Sciences are given material form by the development of satellite prototype projects, an applied approach that follows modern pedagogical practice. In order to have a "hands-on" experience in Space Systems Engineering, students are invited to take part in the design and construction of an "on-desk" satellite prototype, applying the knowledge gained in classes, from the first sketch to the final assembly of components and system integration and testing. SATPRUST refers to the latest version of the satellite prototyping experience, with the satellite prototype itself based on a carefully designed lightweight acrylic 3D printed structure with a Raspberry PI Camera and CPU, brushless DC motors, speed controllers, Li ion batteries and an RC control, all mounted inside a gyroscopic structure. The prototype is completely modular, and is therefore easily assembled and disassembled. Thanks to the current low (and decreasing) costs of new electronic and mechanical components, the development of TICs, and input from experienced senior aerospace engineers, a satellite prototype can now be made for less than US$400. Initiatives like SATPRUST are feasible and attractive for developing countries such as Chile that do not have a fully developed aerospace industry, and offers an interesting and modern educational approach for students that can potentially foster real on-Space satellite projects in the next few years as part of a step-by-step approach to space program development. This paper addresses the method used for the SATPRUST project and presents feedback from students about their learning experiences.  2018 International Astronautical Federation IAF.

N2  - Paper depicts an architecture expansion for communication and data management that can be used in Remote Experimentation and Game-Based Learning. This architecture is compliant with iLab Shared Architecture and is based upon open source software and hardware, in particular low cost platforms such as the Raspberry Pi 3. It consists of three main entities: user-side interface, experiment-side (lab) application and, interconnecting both, the cloud server enhanced with the messaging intermediator. Architecture takes into account typical requirements for educational institutions, such as open-source technologies, remote systems usage management (service brokerage) and security. In trial implementations, three single-user, remotely operated experiments have been enabled using ELSA-Py, in which students will be able to practice concepts of lean production (LyMIE), object position control (Windball) and image calibration (TabRecon). The integration has been tested and the performance of ELSA-Py architecture as a tool do deploy educational remotely operated systems is discussed.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper documents the augmentation of Raspberry PI (plus its camera module) to a typical VEX robot, yielding a mobile robot with onboard image processing capability. The VEX robot denotes a robot constructed using the VEX robotic kit, which is controlled and programmed by the Cortex microprocessor that comes with the kit. Though the Cortex microprocessor is powerful enough for motion control and processing sensors such as integrated encoder, sonar range sensor, and touch sensor, the current VEX robotic kit does not provide a true vision sensor that allows real-time image processing. To enhance the functionality of the VEX robot, a Raspberry PI (with its camera module) is introduced to the robotic system, where the PI will be dedicated for image processing. Information extracted from the video sequence are then sent via UART port to the Cortex, which controls the basic motion of the robot. Detailed procedures to construct the vision-enhanced VEX robot is described. The resulting robotic system with the Raspberry PI and Cortex combination greatly expands the usage and application domain of the robot, making it suitable for more complex and advanced tasks such as vision-based control, visual servoing, and visual tracking. This paper also provides a sample lesson plan that consists of basic motion in 2D (controlling the mobile base only), trajectory generation in 3D (controlling a robotic arm on top of the mobile base), and examples of advanced topics (e.g., vision-based control). We believe these projects will significantly improve an existing robotics curriculum, enhance students' hand-on skills, and lead to more challenging undergraduate projects.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Robotics curricula that include programming generally require a robotics controller as core platform. The controller and its capabilities shape the offered curriculum in terms of programming means, and therefore age appropriateness. A closed, black-box controller also limits the uses outside the context of such a curriculum. The Hedgehog Light controller aims to imply as few limitations as possible by using open source methodology, the open and well-docu-mented Raspberry Pi, a multi-platform protocol and programming interface, and that can mostly be built in fabrication laboratories (fab labs).

N2  - The exponential nature of the technological progress, along with the need for smaller and mobile computers led to the emergence of embedded devices like Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black. The main difficulty in using these embedded devices is that the device must be physically connected to a regular computer in order to be programmed to do useful work. This thesis presents a platform named Wyliodrin that solves this problem by allowing the programming of embedded devices directly from the Cloud.  2016 IEEE.

The system is equipped with a touch-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) from which the robot's joints and the robot's end-effectors can be easily controlled in the joint and Cartesian space respectively. A visual representation of the legs pose were integrated in the interface allowing the operator to test the motion of the limbs before their actual execution on the real robot. The forward and inverse kinematic models were formalized according to the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and implemented in Python 3 with the support of the Tkinter, NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. The chassis of the teach-pendant was designed using SolidWorks software to accommodate a 9-inch display with a touch sensor, a 5000 mAh battery, a Raspberry pi 3, and an ATmega168 microcontroller. On the frontal panel, rotary encoders and different buttons are present to access the menu and precisely tune the control variables.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Programming is back on the curriculum. The goal of the Raspberry Pi Foundation is to promote computing education by taking children back to the basics of programming computers and to "foster a renaissance in coding", in the words of Raspberry Pi Foundation's director, Eben Upton.1,2 To facilitate this, the Foundation has developed a fully functioning computer that retails for just $25. As educationalists embrace the introduction of coding to the curriculum, penetration tester Andrew Mason, technical director of RandomStorm, examines the disconnect between knowing how to code and knowing how to code securely. This gap has resulted in many websites being vulnerable to the same kinds of exploit - most notably Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Using the Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) tool, Mason demonstrates simple tests used by penetration testers to identify backdoors used by hackers. And he looks at how we might work our way towards a safer future online.  2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - In this paper, we report on our "Iridis-Pi" cluster, which consists of 64 Raspberry Pi Model B nodes each equipped with a 700 MHz ARM processor, 256 Mbit of RAM and a 16 GiB SD card for local storage. The cluster has a number of advantages which are not shared with conventional data-centre based cluster, including its low total power consumption, easy portability due to its small size and weight, affordability, and passive, ambient cooling. We propose that these attributes make Iridis-Pi ideally suited to educational applications, where it provides a low-cost starting point to inspire and enable students to understand and apply high-performance computing and data handling to tackle complex engineering and scientific challenges. We present the results of benchmarking both the computational power and network performance of the "Iridis-Pi." We also argue that such systems should be considered in some additional specialist application areas where these unique attributes may prove advantageous. We believe that the choice of an ARM CPU foreshadows a trend towards the increasing adoption of low-power, non-PC-compatible architectures in high performance clusters.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - We address the challenge of high speed autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) using DNNs in GPS-denied environments with limited computational resources; specifically, we use the ODROID XU4 and the Raspberry Pi 3. The high computation costs of using DNNs for inference, particularly in the absence of powerful GPUs, necessitates negotiating a tradeoff between accuracy and inference. We address this tradeoff by employing sparsified neural networks. To obtain such architectures, we propose a novel algorithm to find sparse "sub networks" of existing pre trained models. Contrary to existing pruning-only strategies, our proposal includes a novel exploration step that efficiently searches for a different, but identically sparse, architecture with better generalization abilities. We derive learning theoretic bounds that reinforce our empirical findings that the optimized network achieves comparable generalization to the original network. We show that using our algorithm it is possible to discover models which, on average, have upto 19x fewer parameters than those obtained using existing state of the art pruning methods on autonomous navigation datasets, and achieve upto 6x improvements on inference time compared to existing state of the art shallow models on the ODROID XU4 and Raspberry Pi 3. Last, we demonstrate that our sparsified models can complete autonomous navigation missions with speeds upto 4m/s using the ODROID XU4, which existing state of the art methods fail to do.  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Ambient intelligence (AmI) deals with a new world of ubiquitous computing devices, where physical environments interact intelligently and unobtrusively with people. AmI environments can be diverse, such as homes, offices, meeting rooms, schools, hospitals, control centers, vehicles, tourist attractions, stores, sports facilities, and music devices. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a testbed for AmI using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian OS. We analyze the performance of Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol in an indoor scenario. For evaluation we considered throughput, delay and jitter metrics. The experimental results show that the nodes in the testbed were communicating smoothly.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) became established during the last decade as an emerging technology with considerable potentialities and applicability. Its paradigm of everything connected together penetrated the real world, with smart devices located in several daily appliances. Such intelligent objects are able to communicate autonomously through already existing network infrastructures, thus generating a more concrete integration between real world and computer-based systems. On the downside, the great benefit carried by the IoT paradigm in our life brings simultaneously severe security issues, since the information exchanged among the objects frequently remains unprotected from malicious attackers. The paper at hand proposes COSMOS (Collaborative, Seamless and Adaptive Sentinel for the Internet of Things), a novel sentinel to protect smart environments from cyber threats. Our sentinel shields the IoT devices using multiple defensive rings, resulting in a more accurate and robust protection. Additionally, we discuss the current deployment of the sentinel on a commodity device (i.e., Raspberry Pi). Exhaustive experiments are conducted on the sentinel, demonstrating that it performs meticulously even in heavily stressing conditions. Each defensive layer is tested, reaching a remarkable performance, thus proving the applicability of COSMOS in a distributed and dynamic scenario such as IoT.With the aim of easing the enjoyment of the proposed sentinel, we further developed a friendly and ease-to-use COSMOS App, so that end-users can manage sentinel(s) directly using their own devices (e.g., smartphone).  2019 by the authors.

N2  - We present here an IoT-based platform that provides an integrated solution for real-time monitoring and management of educational buildings at a national scale. The proposed system follows the Fog Computing paradigm so that sensor data processing takes place at the edge devices of the network. In this way, the system significantly reduces the network traffic across the network core layers. The architecture and implementation of the system are presented in details in relation to existing use-case scenaria. The performance of the prototype architecture is evaluated in a real-world environment using a range of edge devices available in a pilot deployment spanning across 18 school buildings. The evaluation indicates that existing resources are sufficient to accommodate traffic that can increase up to 5 times higher from the existing one even in sites where low-end devices (e.g., such as Raspberry Pi) are available. The results provide evidence that Fog Computing can address the ever-increasing amount of data that is inherent in an IoT world by effective communication among all elements of the architecture.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents the results of a controlled one semester study where students responded to a hardware upgrade from the Texas Instruments TMS320C6713 DSK development board to the Beagleboard-xM platform in the laboratory associated with the first Electrical and Computer Engineering course in signal processing at the undergraduate level. The sophomore-level course in signal processing is required of all engineering majors and provides a foundation in the mathematical modeling and analysis of signals and of linear time-invariant systems. The laboratory component of the course utilizes applications of signal processing to motivate the breadth of the field which includes filters, AM modulation, and Nyquist sampling theory. In this study, both the TMS320C6713 DSK development board with its 225MHz processor and the newer Beagleboard-xM with its 1 GHz processer provide students with a real-time, programmable signal-processing hardware platform that enhances the learning experience. The DSK board requires the use of an intermediary software tool, Code Composer Studio to compile and program whereas the Beagleboard interfaces directly with MATLAB. Analysis of the usefulness of the hardware upgrade was carried out by assessing students' acceptance of the DSK versus the Beagleboard-xM in terms of its usefulness and usability over four key laboratory experiments: Digital Audio Effects, Touch-Tone Phone, Voice Scrambler-Descrambler, and Sampling and Aliasing. The extent to which the two hardware platforms were able to successfully achieve learning outcomes in the course is also presented.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.

N2  - In this paper, we introduce a low-cost setup to convert an infrared (IR) controllable device to a smart IoT device. We design and implement a circuit board containing an IR sensor and multiple IR LEDs in parallel that transmit up to around seventeen meters. The board has an interface that can be connected to a Raspberry Pi and other similar devices. Our IR signal learning tool can record IR signals of an IR remote while our IR replay tool can replay the recorded signals to control the corresponding IR device. Therefore, a smartphone can be used to remotely control IR devices through an MQTT broker on a cloud server since the Raspberry Pi can be connected to the cloud. We also introduce the security implications of infrared communication using our setup and demonstrate attack scenarios. For example, a drone armed with our device can remotely turn off a TV - https://youtu.be/rPbzPbWrbf8 or http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzQ0Njc5MzM3Ng.  2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Non-formal learning settings enable self-selected groups of children to participate in out-of-school activities related to their interests, with participation primarily governed by intrinsic motivation. In contrast, formal learning incorporates external rewards through assessment activities which engender extrinsic motivation. Here we describe an exploratory study carried out in computing clubs for primary-aged children, held outside the formal curriculum in schools and libraries. The objectives of the study, involving 12 clubs and 115 children aged 6 to 11, were to investigate the feasibility of introducing assessment opportunities to computing clubs and to consider the impact of rewards in this context. Children worked on programming projects, and were given quizzes to complete at the end of club sessions, with children at some of the clubs being given both quizzes and 'rewards' charts, with badges for completing the projects. We found that quizzes with badges were favourably received by both children and educators. Results indicated that including badges as a form of tracking and rewarding progress significantly increased enjoyment of the assessment activity. This study is part of a larger study looking at learning outcomes in computing clubs, and has implications for others in non-formal computing settings.  2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - Todays embedded platforms enable executing difficult tasks such as visual tracking. However, such resource-constrained systems are still facing challenges regarding the performance and accuracy in executing these tasks. This paper presents the evaluation of 5 open-source visual tracking implementations available from the contributions branch of the Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) library. This evaluation is performed based on the performance and accuracy of these implementations when embedded in a Raspberry Pi. The algorithms evaluated are On-Line Boosting, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), Median Flow, Tracking-Learning-Detection (TLD), and Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF). Even if commercial implementations of these algorithms perform better than their open-source version, the popularity of OpenCV motivates this evaluation. Tests are based on a benchmark of 100 video streams from which the tracking implementations should follow moving objects. The algorithms are evaluated for accuracy using averaged Jaccard indices and for performance by measuring their frame rate. We want to find an open-source implementation that performs well on these two criteria when tested on an embedded platform. Results show Median Flow being the fastest but its accuracy is the lowest. We therefore recommend KCF as it is the second fastest and the most accurate.  Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

N2  - There are many applications employing image processing and/or control algorithms. Video surveillance, visual inspection of manufactured goods are among the examples. Self - driven cars are today one of the hottest topic. Using powerful image processing, control and learning technologies, self-driven vehicles appears to be just around the corner. Another possible application are robots in charge of moving manufactured parts between the stations. Indeed, robotic-carriers (wheeled or tracked) may be visually guided to follow colored lines painted on the floor in order to automatically transport parts between the stations. This paper presents the construction and the implementation of such a visually guided vehicle which is able to follow a white line on a dark background. The vehicle is controlled by a so called embedded computer (a Raspberry Pi board) which uses a camera, minimal image processing and simple control law in order to command the vehicle to 'stay on the line'. A description of the vehicle, the setup of the Raspberry Pi board and the image processing and control are also described. The obtained results are also presented.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Three week short-term full semester coverage Intersession courses were successfully developed by the home institution as a tool to increase student international awareness while delivering substantial technical content. Course offerings have included engineering core and engineering elective courses taught in a short-term study abroad format by home institution faculty. The success in delivering such engineering courses in a three-week format has been demonstrated [1]. New study-abroad courses in Engineering Programming required for all engineering majors, and Signals and Systems that is required for Electrical Engineering majors were developed as Intersession courses taught in London. These courses were developed to be completely portable, where required hardware and software were acquired by students prior to leaving from the home institution for the study-abroad courses for use at the international location. The Engineering Programming class used the Raspberry Pi as the computation and programming Engine. Students used their personal computers via Virtual Network Computing (VNC) sharing system. This interfacing allows the portable personal computer as the terminal and display device for the Raspberry Pi. The use of a Raspberry Pi in Engineering Programming allowed for instruction in C programming using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). The type of programming exercises were widened beyond typical computational-only programs, to sensing and actuating external devices via the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. The complete kit or "box" consists of a Raspberry Pi 3, power supply, case, Micro-SD Card pre-loaded with the GCC compiler and other required software, select sensors and actuators, and interface cables. The Signals and Systems course used MATLAB as the computational software platform. In addition, the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 system was used, in conjunction with microphones, to capture audio signals for analysis using MATLAB. Students were additionally able to expand their understanding of the impact of engineering solutions from a global and societal viewpoint with a visit to Bletchley Park where Alan Turing accomplished his breakthrough work on a deciphering the Enigma Code, and to the British Museum of Computing. Assessment of the program consists of the course evaluation, student surveys, and formalized micro-observations.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.

N2  - Smell is one of the six senses of human beings and there is not a lot of work on that sense, therefore, this paper is based on that sense. It aims to develop Electronic Nose (E-Nose) that will work not only to determine the ripeness level of fruits but also to make prediction that how long they will remain in that particular stage and also the classification of fruits as well, through smell. In order to achieve that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used. Hardware components include ME3-C2H4 sensors, Raspberry pi 3. The researchers work almost 10 hours daily to get the dataset of ethylene gas as accurate as possible. The dataset will then be used in KNN algorithm for classification (to determine the name) categorization (to determine the ripeness level) of fruits. On the basis of experiments the success rate of this system is 70%.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - An adaptive controller for regulating and dimming problems of LED current control is developed in this article when the LED driving system is considered as a class of unknown nonlinear discrete-time systems. The controller is designed by a Fuzzy-rules emulated network (FREN) with direct human knowledge as IF-THEN rules of the controlled plant. The online learning algorithm is established to tune all adjustable parameters of FREN with the convergence analysis. The prototyping system is constructed by using Raspberry Pi model B as a main processing unit. Experimental results validate the satisfied performance for both current regulation and dimmer applications with positive and negative slopes.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - A portable and affordable laboratory kit for an undergraduate control systems course will be demonstrated. The kit includes a Raspberry Pi (a single board computer), DC motor, and other circuits and sensors. The kit's custom components were 3D printed. All other components of the kit can be purchased from online retailers such as Adafruit or Sparkfun for a total cost of about $130. This kit could replace expensive equipment with an affordable alternative that can be easily shipped anywhere in the world and used by students with any computer. The low cost and portability of the kit greatly enhance the accessibility of the laboratory experience to students in budget-strapped campus laboratories and those participating in distance education. Using a DC motor allows the instructor to assign experiments using a proportional-integralderivative (PID) to control the motor's position.1Additionally, a DC motor setup can be expanded to create more complex setups like the inverted pendulum.2Inverted pendulum experiments can illustrate different types of systems and different types of control methods. These methods include bang-bang control, fuzzy logic control, neural network control, PID adaptive control, robust control, hybrid control, predictive control, and feed-forward control.3Because of this versatility, both the DC Motor and inverted pendulum systems will be used as the basis for the kit being developed.

N2  - A portable and cost-effective cosmic ray detector designed and built for engineering and scientific education and research is presented. The design is an improvement over previous designs as it allows for more flexibility in setting up experimental conditions. The basic design and operation are described. Preliminary background photon measurements, predominantly gamma rays, are presented. The detector's response to a radioactive mineral, monazite, is shown. The use of a histogram in lieu of a multi-channel analyzer to capture the shape of the gamma spectrum is demonstrated. The results show that the detector can reliably detect the intensity and energy spectrum of gamma radiation. This cosmic ray detector is designed to be used in large-scale physics research as well as projects involving Raspberry Pi and Internet of Things.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Passive WiFi radar shows significant promise for a wide range of applications in both security and healthcare owing to its detection, tracking and recognition capabilities. However, studies examining micro-Doppler classification using passive WiFi radar have relied on manually stimulating WiFi access points to increase the bandwidths and duty-cycles of transmissions; either through file-downloads to generate high data-rate signals, or increasing the repetition frequency of the WiFi beacon signal from its default setting. In real-world scenarios, both these approaches would require user access to the WiFi network or WiFi access point through password authentication, and therefore involve a level of cooperation which cannot always be relied upon e.g. in law-enforcement applications. In this research, we investigate WiFi activity classification using just WiFi probe response signals which can be generated using a low-cost off-the-shelf secondary device (Raspberry Pi) eliminating the requirement to actually connect to the WiFi network. This removes the need to have continuous data traffic in the network or to modify the firmware configuration to manipulate the beacon signal interval, making the technology deployable in all situations. An activity recognition model based on a convolutional neural network resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 75% when trained from scratch using 300 measured WiFi probe-response samples across 6 classes. This value is then increased to 82%, with significantly less training when adopting a transfer learning approach: initial training using WiFi data traffic signals, followed by fine-tuning using probe response signals.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Telemedicine and Telehealth are disciplines dedicated to provide health care and health care education when distance is an issue. Nowadays, Telemedicine and Telehealth Stations (TTSs) are used to provide physicians and educators with tools that concentrate and integrate different technologies, contributing to organize and simplify their workload. To support scenarios involving features related to teleconsultation and tele-education, TTSs must consider the adoption of hardware platforms robust enough to reach minimal requirements while providing service deliverability and continuity. Despite being usually built for execution on desktops and laptops, it is possible that TTSs be reorganized to use Single-Board Computers (SBCs) as a most portable-and cost-effective solution. Aiming to evaluate such possibility, this work presents a performance study of four of the most popular SBCs available on the market, focusing the execution of web conferences in the context of the Santa Catarina State Integrated Telemedicine and Telehealth System (STT/SC), in Brazil. Using descriptive statistics, we concluded that the Raspberry Pi 2 SBC is the best option to be adopted, considering its results regarding CPU consumption, memory utilization, and video delay.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - An accurate and robust lane recognition is a key aspect for autonomous cars of the near future. This paper presents the design and implementation of a robust autonomous driving algorithm using the proven Viola-Jones object detection method for lane recognition. The Viola-Jones method is used to detect traffic cones that are located besides the road as it can be done in emergency situations. The positions of the traffic cones are analyzed to provide a model of the road. Based on this model, a vehicle is autonomously and safely driven through the emergency situation. The presented approach is implemented on a raspberry pi and evaluated using a driving simulator. For high resolution images with a size of 19201080 pixels, the execution time for object detection is less than 218 ms while a high detection rate is established. Furthermore, the planning and execution for autonomous driving requires only 0.55 ms.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - This learning workshop will prototype and advance theory around the participatory design of hybrid games. In contrast to screen-centered games, our platform makes it easier to repurpose ordinary urban objects - from aging payphones to experimental bus stop displays. The resulting games are hybrids, where the action is alternately woven across the digital and physical. Successful hybrid games offer choices to players that are immediate, from introducing neighbors (building the social fabric), to photographing street art (documenting local culture), buying from a local business (shifting the economy), and revealing local history. Based on three years of experience in South Los Angeles, our methods for Participatory Design (PD) combine low and high-tech to leverage local culture. The resulting games emphasize social mixing - including with local businesses - and are amplified online with flows of pictures, audio and text. For workshop participants, no technology skills are needed - since the platform seeks to maximize participation in the design process. Participants' own knowledge of cities and important cultural neighborhoods will be used to create 2-3 semifunctional games. Hidden in each design is a set of technologies that join communication networks, including cell phone SMS and Raspberry Pi computers hidden inside payphones. The most important result of this workshop may be in identifying PD theory that could help the field of game design, and vice-versa, as the two fields increasingly consider street-based media and how to constitute publics around city streets.

N2  - FarmBot, a small autonomous farming machine, has been recently acquired by the "Smart Farming" project team at University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) for conducting precision farming field experiments on a small scale. The machine seeds, kills weeds, senses soil moisture levels, and irrigates plants individually over 10 feet by 20 feet area. It is, in essence, a three-axis Cartesian robot quite similar to a 3D printer and runs on Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino like microprocessor board. It can be easily manipulated using a web application over a smart phone. The Raspberry Pi Camera (Pi-Cam) integrated with the machine can be used for weed detection and time-lapse photography. Food Science and Technology graduate students are working in concert with engineering undergraduates and UMES staff to oversee the installation and preliminary experimental layout. Some of the pitfalls and successes during the installation of both the hardware and software of the mechatronic device will be highlighted in this work. An initial experiment has been planned to study the effects of hydrogel (super absorbent polymer (SAP) on growing small vegetables. SAPs are being used in agriculture as a soil conditioner that utilizes its water holding capacity to reduce frequent irrigation needs. The area (10 by 20 ft) serviced by the machine has been divided to accommodate four levels of hydrogel with two replicates Initial plans of growing turnips with the FarmBot was unsuccessful due to the severity of winter weather. The project team is considering building a hoop house around the FarmBot to extend the growing season. Immediate plans for the project also include powering the FarmBot with solar panels and meeting its irrigation needs through rain water harvesting.  2019 ASABE Annual International Meeting.

N2  - Named data networking (NDN) is a new Internet architecture that replaces todays focus on where  addresses and hosts with what  the content that users and applications care about. One of NDNs prominent advantages is scalable and efficient content distribution due to its native support of caching and multicast in the network. However, at the last hop to wireless users, often the WiFi link, current NDN implementation still treats the communication as multiple unicast sessions, which will cause duplicate packets and waste of bandwidth when multiple users request for the same popular content. WiFis built-in broadcast mechanism can alleviate this problem, but it suffers from packet loss since there is no MAC-layer acknowledgement as in unicast. In this paper, we develop a new NDN-based cross-layer approach called NLB for efficient and scalable live video streaming over wireless LAN. The core ideas are: using WiFis broadcast channel to deliver content from the access point to the users, a leader-based mechanism to suppress duplicate requests from users, and receiver-driven rate control and loss recovery. The design is implemented and evaluated in a physical testbed comprised of one software AP and 20 Raspberry Pi-based WiFi clients. While NDN with multiple unicast sessions or plain broadcast can support no more than ten concurrent viewers of a 1Mbps streaming video, NDN plus NLB supports all 20 viewers, and Received December 29, 2015; accepted April 28, 2016 E-mail: zhxp@tsinghua.edu.cn can likely support much more when present.  2017, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Minimizing the energy consumption of Linux-based devices is an essential step towards their wide deployment in various IoT scenarios. Energy saving methods such as duty-cycling aim to address this constraint by limiting the amount of time the device is powered on. In this work we study and improve the amount of time a Linux-based IoT device is powered on to accomplish its tasks. We analyze the processes of system boot up and shutdown on two platforms, the Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless, and enhance duty-cycling performance by identifying and disabling time-consuming or unnecessary units initialized in the userspace. We also study whether SD card speed and SD card capacity utilization affect boot up duration and energy consumption. In addition, we propose Pallex, a parallel execution framework built on top of the systemd init system to run a user application concurrently with userspace initialization. We validate the performance impact of Pallex when applied to various IoT application scenarios: (1) capturing an image, (2) capturing and encrypting an image, (3) capturing and classifying an image using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and (4) capturing images and sending them to a cloud server. Our results show that system lifetime is increased by 18.3%, 16.8%, 13.9% and 30.2%, for these application scenarios, respectively.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Engineering schools in low-resource settings typically do not have access to makerspaces, which are common in engineering schools in the USA. Without tools or materials to build and iterate prototypes, instructors often assign paper-only design projects. Students in low-resource settings move through the first half of the design process, including understanding the problem, defining design specifications, generating solution ideas and selecting a solution. But, due to resource constraints, students "stop" the design process with a dimensioned sketch and a description of the materials needed to build the device. Through a long-term collaboration between Rice University and the University of Malawi Polytechnic, we have established a makerspace that is appropriate and sustainable in a low resource setting. The PIDS, or Polytechnic Innovation Design Studio, was established in 2016 with a grant from the Lemelson Foundation. PIDS houses electrical and mechanical prototyping tools such as Arduinos and Raspberry Pi, 3D printers, a laser cutter, a CNC machine, and various hand tools. Prototyping materials include supplies that are readily available in markets in Malawi. PIDS is open to all students across the school of engineering, faculty, recent Polytechnic graduates, and members of the Entrepreneur Hub, and it has become a true innovation hub where over 700 students have participated in hands-on workshops, class work and independent projects since its inception. In conjunction with establishing the PIDS, the required first-year drawing course was modified to include design projects scoped at a district hospital. The projects selected were a traction system for femoral fractures and a manual cast-cutting device. With the curricular modifications, all first-year students completed several steps in the engineering design process and created dimensioned drawings as well as low-fidelity prototypes of their design solutions in the PIDS. The final-year capstone design courses in mechanical and electrical engineering have also been transformed to emphasize prototyping. Final-year students with access to the PIDS completed more steps in the engineering design process, with time allocated to prototyping, testing, and iteration. In the final-year course, students now build projects such as a monitoring system for remote telecommunication sites and a neonatal respiratory rate sensor. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the PIDS and its transformation of the capstone design course. Using pictures of sketches, CAD drawings, and physical prototypes documented in student reports, the number of iterations, the quality of the final products, and the number of type of tools used to produce the final prototype are noted. Comparing before and after the opening of the PIDS, there are clear improvements in the number of department-specific tools used by student teams as well as the quality of the prototypes. In summary, this paper discusses the creation of a makerspace in a low resource setting and the impact the facility has had on the design education at the University of Malawi Polytechnic campus.

N2  - The objective of this research work is to propose a weed detecting robotic model for sugarcane fields that uses a fuzzy real time classifier on leaf textures. The differentiation between weed and crop and weed removal are the two challenging tasks for the farmers especially in the Indian sugarcane cultivation scenario. The automatic weed detection and removal becomes a vital task for improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the agricultural processes. The detection of weeds by the robotic model employs a Raspberry Pi based control system placed in a moving vehicle. An automated image classification system has been designed which extracts leaf textures and employs a fuzzy real-time classification technique. Morphological operators are applied to extract circular leaf patterns in different scales from the leaf images. An optimal set of features have been identified for the characterization of crops and weeds in sugarcane fields. A weed detecting robotic prototype is designed and developed using a Raspberry Pi micro controller and suitable input output subsystems such as cameras, small light sources and motors with power systems. The prototype's control incorporates the weed detection mechanism using a Raspbian operating system support and python programming. The designed robotic prototype correctly identifies the sugarcane crop among nine different weed species. The system detects weeds with 92.9% accuracy over a processing time of 0.02 s.  2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Computed Tomography is a technique to reconstruct an image of trans-Axial slab of the object from a series of x-ray radiographs taken at a prior-known angle. Sequences of x-ray radiographs are served as two-dimensional projection data for a 3D tomography. The most popular Feldkamp Algorithm which is based on Filtered Backprojection (FBP) approaches has shown to perform well for 3D reconstruction. Conventional x-ray computed tomography was implemented on a c-Arm x-ray apparatus where the x-ray tube and detector is capable of rotating to capture radiograph at any specific angle. In this paper, we designed the simulated computed tomography that can be used for educational purpose. A number of digital cameras are attached on the rotating gantry to capture a series of image around the object. This mimics a conebeam projection for computed tomography. In order to design the embedded system, Raspberry Pi is used as the main microcontroller which acts as data acquisition system. All projection data are sent to cloud server which is later download to PC for further processing.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - To distinguish the classes of unknown data, classification is an important technique. If implemented on hardware these techniques provide more accuracy, faster response in real time predictions than any software implementation. Existing hardware implementations are not at all cost effective, and require specific knowledge of hardware platform. In this paper a cost effective implementation of a statistical classifier has been proposed on Raspberry Pi, an open source hardware platform. This proposed implementation provides on board training of the classifier and real time class prediction. Moreover, it does not require knowledge about the hardware platform to classify the data.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - The Design, Build, Go Hub (DBG) is a universal power hub that not only encapsulates the various branches of robotic engineering, but also transforms a student's creativity into a physical product. The hub serves as both control mechanism and the power delivery system for student designs. The universal design is easily implemented to provide automation to designs including quadcopters, wheeled platforms, and mechanized robotics. This hub gives students the opportunity to gain exposure to electrical, mechanical and systems engineering, as well as how the various disciplines can be integrated into a cohesive design. Powered by a Raspberry Pi 2 microcontroller with a motor controller interface, the DBG Hub can interface with a variety of sensors, motors, servos, cameras and various other electrical components. The mechanical system also has a vast number of possibilities by utilizing rapid prototyping such as 3D printing, vacuum forming, and machining. The DBG Hub was designed to be capable of receiving a vast amount of rapid prototyped parts for nearly any type of mechanical function. The housing, which holds the electrical system, is also a product of rapid prototyping technology. The 3D printed design allows users to create attachments with corresponding electrical components that plug into the housing for a variety of projects. The combination of rapid prototyping with the microcontroller allows the hub to take full advantage of combining the mechanical design with the electrical components. This combination is used to create systems that can sense, think and react. Sample projects created utilizing the DBG hub as the central control unit, such as the DBG quad-copter, or the DBG land vehicle, perfectly showcase these attributes in an introductory manner. These sample projects have been designed and software created as introductory tools for students interested in engineering. The effectiveness of the hub being able to interest students in engineering will be the subject of a future study. This study will show how simplifying the incorporation of multiple engineering disciplines into one easy to use tool is the simplest and most efficient way to become more knowledgeable of the engineering field. While this study has not yet been conducted, it can still be stated that the DBG Hub is an original and groundbreaking design that will excite, promote, and, most importantly, educate students in the field of engineering.

N2  - Timing is critical when trying to engage students in various engineering career paths. While many 'National Engineers Week' programs exist for primary and middle school students, there is a lack of hands on activities for students in the 9th-12th grades. It is often difficult to devise experiments for this age group that are interesting and not juvenile. Yet, it is during these crucial years that most students are lost to science, math and engineering. Engaging students and presenting opportunities for invention and excitement is important in the teen years, when peer pressure and the distractions of friends, social events, and activities are particularly high.1. There are a number of open source programming and affordable hardware platforms that can be used to implement low cost and interactive programs to promote innovation with various age groups. In this paper we share our work, as well as our learnings on how to make the workshops more effective. We have created various Arduino projects that can be customized to grade levels ranging from grades 7-12, and even college undergraduate students. The various projects we describe in this paper have been used to interact with students of different grade levels to engage in basic elements of engineering and computer programming. The classes should be set up to work in groups to promote shared innovation, teamwork and collaboration with peers. The open source and hardware experimenting exposed the students to various career paths ranging from software engineer, to electronic engineers and basic elements of various other engineering paths. This paper is designed to demonstrate the promotion of the engineering profession in schools through the use of Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi Gemma kits, and Flora kits. The programs are also designed to accommodate classroom setting, workshops, or as an in-class field trip.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - Recently, a new research field 'Computational Ethology' is attracting much attention from not only biologists but also computer scientists because advances in computer technology enabled to automate the measurement and the analysis of animal behavior. Especially, analyzing communications performed by honeybee workers in their hive is one of the most important and interesting issue in ethological research area to reveal a mechanism of honeybee's language. However, these analyses have been usually conducted by manually extracting honeybee's walking trajectories from recorded long-Time video data. For a systematic and theoretical analysis of honeybee's communication, we have developed an automatic tracking algorithm of multiple honeybees using image processing and constructed an automatic recording system for long-Term tracking of honeybee behaviors with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors and high-resolution camera modules using multiple small-size single board computers, Raspberry Pi. Using this system, we conducted recording experiments from 6:30 am to 7:30 pm during one month once or twice per a year from 2015 to 2018. In this paper, first we show the overview of a behavior monitoring system of honeybee in hive. Next, we explain the simultaneous tracking algorithm we proposed. Finally, we show the experimental results and confirm the system capabilities.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - This paper has proposed a new design of active lower limb orthosis which is called as oneDHALO (one-actuator Drive Hip and Ankle Linked Orthosis). The oneDHALO has a linking mechanism which connects both ankle joints with a medial hip joint and an actuator which drives the rotation angle. The joints linkage mechanism keeps feet always in parallel with the floor to avoid stumbling and assists swinging of the leg. In addition, one servo motor has been introduced to assist and control the movement constrained by the mechanism. To match the active movement to walking phase, optical sensors have been introduced at soles of the feet. The control device which consists of internal communication system, sensor interfaces and a single board computer (Raspberry Pi) is designed for all in one with the mechanical part of the orthosis. This presentation reveals the preliminary experimental results of the system to show the good points of the design.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - Undergraduate engineering students who are learning Digital Signal Processing (DSP) are expected to have the ability to implement their theoretical knowledge in various applications soon after graduation. In this paper, we present a laboratory experiment developed for undergraduate students that addresses the challenge of getting them familiar with implementing DSP algorithms in heterogeneous multicore systems. In a top-down approach, the students first gain control of the development environment, and then implement DSP algorithms on a general purpose and on a digital signal processor core. Through the experiment, they get to appreciate the advantages of DSP core architecture in performing signal processing algorithms, and learn methods for timing and data transfer between cores while meeting real-time constraints. In a limited time frame, this hands-on laboratory experiment exposes the students to state-of-the-art multicore development practices and increases their knowledge and interest in DSP and in embedded programming.  2014 EURASIP.

N2  - In the new era of AI and IoT, it's crucial to guide students to learn principles of computer systems design with both hardware (HW) and software (SW), or at least equip them with a HW-SW co-design concept. To overcome the lack of hardware reconfigurability in conventionally leveraged single-board computers (SBCs, e.g., Raspberry Pi) in class, this poster delivers ZyCube, a heterogeneous 4-node SoC-FPGA mini-cluster. These four nodes are orchestrated in a manner of on-demand network service to support a dozen of students to agilely and simultaneously conduct computer systems projects. Three capacity-building course projects are shown with ZyCube, which are (1) HW design of a simplified CPU core with performance profiling using C-language microbenchmarks, (2) rapid co-design of a deep neural network inference accelerator with the CPU core, and (3) datapath optimization with a co-designed DMA engine. These projects are believed to help students to obtain a comprehensive perspective of HW-SW coordination and teachers to leverage a similar platform and pedagogy in their courses.  2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - In this paper, we develop a low-cost portable spectrometer based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) method. The purpose of the spectrometer development is for halal food research project. The portable spectrometer uses various light-emitting diodes (LEDs), light sensor and Arduino microcontroller. The initial research of the spectrometer is testing various oil, such as palm oil, olive oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, and lard. The waveform analysis of each oil can be distinguished by spectroscopy method. But, by using Support Vector Machines (SVM) method the various oil can be distinguished and classified better. The data measurement, classification, and graphical interface result show on the interface of Raspberry Pi based on Python 2.7. Thus, the spectrometer can be used for lard detection.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, we propose and evaluate several details of using heterogeneous hardware in Unmanned Vehicles (UV). We take advantage of a previous UV general proposal, and identify several problems of using a single hardware (for 'doing it all') platform. A single low cost and well-known computing hardware such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi is not enough for a large number of applications, so we take advantage of each hardware in terms of Arduino real-time processing and Raspberry Pi software development and high-level interfaces. Furthermore, we experiment on specific limitations which imply that a single hardware approach would be more expensive in terms of cost, development, and maintenance work. Interestingly, the general UV approach is not changed, it is only adapted in specific scenarios and applications. We focus on the characterization of such scenarios for maintaining a methodological UV construction.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Microcontrollers and single-board computers are widespread tools for innovative educational labs, for prototyping and for accomplish everyday tasks by expert users. Moreover, these modules are opening new exciting possibilities in the area of biological and chemical assays. In this study a Raspberry Pi computer assembled with 3D printed parts and inexpensive opto-electronic components were employed to analyse the antioxidant capacity of several bottled tea performing diphenylpicryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) tests. A dedicated python software allowed the execution of the analysis controlling the device through a small LCD touch screen or remotely through secure connections with other devices. The Raspberry Pi-based measurements were compared with a research-grade spectrophotometer showing excellent correlation (R2 = 0.9996) and no significant differences (p  0.05) in the range of measured values. We strongly believe that this approach could support diagnostics progress in resource-poor countries and open new opportunities in research and education.  2018

N2  - The rapidly changing needs of modern education can be effectively supported by today's small, intelligent devices including tablet PCs, smart phones programmable routers and credit-card sized computers like the Raspberry PI. Since there are many available sensors on the market, it is rather easy to connect real world signal to these devices like temperature, light intensity, acceleration and many more. This way an exciting, cheap, transparent and very efficient software-based real experimentation can be carried out at different levels of education. Our solution is based on a flexible, easily programmable popular router and a universal sensor-to-USB interface with open source software and hardware plus well documented educational applications. The router provides a computer platform for data acquisition and control while also serves as a remotely accessible device through its wired and wireless ports. In our presentation we shall briefly introduce the system setup and the connection of sensors and actuators. We have developed and tested a simple but efficient temperature control example educational application that can be remotely monitored and controlled via the internet. The transparent hardware and software can be used to attract students' attention, also supports the development of creativity by allowing modifications of the software and hardware configuration.  2013 MIPRO.

N2  - According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice, there were 15.9 million property crimes in the U.S. in 2016. It is at a rate of 119.4 invasions per 1,000 households. Home security providers, such as ADT, charge consumers monthly subscription fees for home monitoring system and services. In this research, we address this issue by proposing an easy-to-use, customizable and affordable home security system for the public. Total Security, a Raspberry Pi-based home security system, was designed to monitor and control your home security remotely. The whole system consists of a system server, Raspberry Pi devices, sensors and an Android application. MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) Paho protocol is implemented to communicate between sensors, system server and the Android application. With the use of Total Security Android application, the users can connect to the self-monitoring security system, arm and disarm the system, monitor real-time status of sensors, enable notification upon sensor activation, and view logs of system activity. The contribution of this research is that we demonstrated it is possible to build an affordable home security system with existing devices and technologies. Total Security not only provides the users with an ability to fully control their home security system remotely, but it also considers the extendibility by implementing state-of-the-art protocols.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents a Teach Repeat (TR) algorithm from stereo and inertial data, targeting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with limited on-board computational resources. We propose a tightly-coupled, relative formulation of the visual-inertial constraints that fits the TR application. In order to achieve real-time operation on limited hardware, we constraint it to motion-only visual-inertial Bundle Adjustment and solve for the minimal set of states. For the repeat phase, we show how to generate a trajectory and smoothly follow it with a constantly changing reference frame. The proposed method is validated with the sequences of the EuRoC dataset as well as within a simulated environment, running on a standard laptop PC and on a low-cost Odroid X-U4 computer.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - The proposed Brain-Computer Interface system enables Quadriplegic patients, people with severe motor disabilities to send commands to electronic devices and communicate with ease. Interactive sessions are vital for effective knowledge transfer in any learning eco-system. The growth of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has led to rapid development in 'Assistive Systems' for the disabled called 'assistive domotics'. Brain-Computer-Interface is capable of reading the brainwaves of an individual and analyse it to obtain some meaningful data. This processed data can be used to assist people having speech disorders and sometimes people with limited locomotion to communicate. In this Project, Emotiv EPOC Headset is used to obtain the electroencephalogram (EEG). The obtained data is processed to communicate pre-defined commands and queries for interactive learning. EEG data can also be used to monitor student's emotional behaviour and provide emotional feedback to the students. Other Vital Information like the heartbeat, blood pressure, ECG and temperature are monitored and uploaded to the server. The Data is processed in Intel Edison, system on chip (SoC). Patient metrics are displayed via Intel IoT Analytics cloud service.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Internet of things (IoT) and digitalization of industries are changing the skills required from newly graduated engineers. To truly master these skills, they must be included in the curriculum, and a platform on which students can create IoT projects is needed. The research of IoT and related areas also benefits from such a platform. The platform presented in this paper focuses on a simple coffee maker but applies techniques and tools which are also used in larger scale projects, thereby making the system a valid solution for education. The devices and tools applied must be selected to satisfy education and research requirements. The proposed platform is built on IBM Cloud, and it uses Raspberry Pi as an edge device. Hands-on experience with a real IoT platform brings definite advantages that may otherwise be difficult to achieve.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Today in the world, there are numerous educational experiments teleoperetad to support the teaching of engineering, but the number of this remote experiments in the area of metal forming is not enough. This article will show a new remote experiment called Educational Compression Testing Machine teleoperated via Internet. This experiment will create the possibility for the students to do a real compression test and to collect force applied in the specimen and size data during the experimentation process. These data will be useful for the construction of flow curve of metals aiming the calculation for projects of formed parts. The remote experiment is divided in two basic parts: the website and the Educational Compression Testing Machine. For data acquisition, control and data processing, as well as the interface between the user and the machine was used the Raspberry Pi that is a small size and low cost microcomputer. The reduced structure for the experiment and the low cost were defined as priority for this work, aiming to fit the necessity of undeveloped countries.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - In this study, we propose a new framework for hands-on educational modules to introduce ideas in AI and robotics casually, quickly, and effectively in one package for beginners of all ages in STEAM fields. Today, courses on introductory robotics are found everywhere, from K-12 summer camps to adult continuing education. However, most of them are limited to learning basic skills on sensor-actuator interactions due to their limited time and can rarely introduce what recent exciting AI can do, such as image recognition. As a case study to demonstrate the idea of the framework, an educational module to create a toy car with a camera controlled by Raspberry Pi is introduced. Our approach uses both physical and digital environments. Participants experience running their toy cars on a physical track using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained based on how participants drive cars in a virtual game. The tested idea can be extensible as a framework to many other examples of robotics projects and can make ideas of AI and robotics more accessible to everyone. A proposed AI model is trained to assimilate the participant's game-play style in a VR environment which will be later re-enacted by the physical robot assembled by participants. Through this approach, we intend to demonstrate the AI's ability to personalize things and hope to stimulate participants' curiosity and motivation to learn.  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - This paper documents an innovative approach to teaching a 3-credit introductory C programming course to freshman electrical engineering students that has been funded by an NSF DUE grant. The innovation stems from the use of electrical engineering applications and projects to motivate students to master language syntax and implement key programming concepts and best practices. Weekly three-hour laboratory sessions center around writing C code on a Raspberry Pi computer to interact with a variety of sensors, actuators, and electronic components and achieve laboratory goals. The laboratory experience culminates with a multi-week group project designed to challenge the students' new knowledge and skills. The new course has been taught three times from Spring 2014 through Fall 2015 with a total enrollment of about 60 students. The new course has been run in parallel with a traditional 2-credit introductory C class that typically had about twice as many students. Program evaluation was conducted by a research team which operated separately from but advised the team of instructors about course improvements. Mixed research methods included student surveys, classroom observation, and student interviews. Surveys comparing between students in the alternative and the traditional courses were conducted at the beginning and end of each semester, and in the subsequent semester after students took the class. Results show that students found the alternative class more collaborative, less competitive, and having a greater sense of community than the traditional class.

N2  - This paper describes a practical approach in teaching control engineering topics. A simplified helicopter model is introduced as an example. A controller design stabilizing the simplified helicopter around the yaw-axis is presented. It is used in a flipped classroom concept, that allows students to gain hands-on experience in the field of control engineering. Moreover, a helicopter test-bench for the simplified helicopter is described, that uses a Raspberry Pi as a Matlab Simulink target. The test-bench can be used in classrooms to test the above mentioned controller design. From a education point of view, first experiences with the students show that the test-bench is well accepted and arouses curiosity about the underlying technical problems.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This article presents a low-cost laboratory that has been designed and developed to enhance learning experience and help students gain skills and knowledge in the field of distributed systems. In order to build a comprehensive distributed file system, we used the laboratory consisting of 40 card-sized Raspberry Pi devices, with the accent on stability, scalability, and low cost. Aiming to assess the impact of this new learning environment on the learning process and its outcomes, we surveyed students following the completion of three project stages during the 17 laboratory exercises in one academic year, ensuring that we maintained the same subjects of study during the experiments. Supported by interesting answers on various sets of questions, we provide a valuable insight into students' experience, obstacles and observations during system's implementation. This particular insight paves the way toward further laboratory improvement, adopting this approach in other courses related to ours, and encouraging teachers to embrace similar practice regardless of the field of education.  1979-2012 IEEE.

N2  - The open-source hardware movement is becoming increasingly popular due to the emergence of successful low-cost technologies, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and thanks to the community of makers that actively share their creations to be freely studied, modified, and re-distributed. Numerous authors have proposed distinct ways to seize this approach for accomplishing a variety of learning goals: enabling scholars to explore scientific concepts, promoting students' creativity, helping them to be more fluent and expressive with new technologies, and so on. This paper reports a systematic mapping study that overviews the literature on open-source hardware in education by analyzing and classifying 676 publications. The results of our work provide: 1) guidance on the published material (identifying the most relevant papers, publication sources, institutions, and countries); 2) information about the pedagogical uses of open-source hardware (showing its main educational goals, stages, and topics where it is principally applied); and 3) directions for future research.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - Small computer board platforms, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and micro: bit are very common, cheap, and useful tools to teach modern technology, coding, and experimenting in different disciplines at various levels. Due to the huge available information on websites, it is very easy to find a solution for almost any job and problem, therefore one may not be motivated to work out an own version, to study carefully, to understand the principles in-depth and to be creative. This is also one of the reasons why so high proportion of the examples employ technically inadequate methods, misleading concepts. These are rather serious problems concerning high-quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Although technology and available tools change rapidly, the basic principles remain the same, therefore education should focus on a better understanding of these. On the other hand, it is very important for the future's engineers, developers, and professionals to follow the correct methods, to be reliable, creative, and open to the more and more common interdisciplinary methodology. In this paper, we demonstrate this approach by investigating exciting interdisciplinary phonocardiography and photoplethysmography experiments and related electronics, data acquisition, and signal processing. In our work, we focus on the understanding and applying the correct methods, provide a detailed analysis of common pitfalls and leave room also for additional work. Students and teachers, lecturers can learn what to consider, pick what they find useful for their projects. It is also important to note, that the principles are valid for much other instrumentation and information processing jobs as well.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - This paper shows the experience with the use of pocket labs at CUAS (Carinthia University of Applied Sciences). Two types of pocket labs were used: National Instruments' myDAQ and Raspberry Pi; the courses were Electronic Engineering and Circuit Design, and Image Processing. For each course, some exercises are described as example. After each course, the students were asked for their opinion about the use of pocket labs. The results shown contain answers of about 60 students, both evening and regular. In general, students appreciate the use of pocket labs due to the flexibility in time and the possibility to repeat exercises for a better understanding. There appeared a small difference between the results relating to evening and regular students; evening students, which a generally limited in time, prefer the flexible time management when using pocket labs, and regular students, which usually have less technical background, prefer the easier understanding of the content.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - Parameter estimation of Lorenz chaotic system using a novel hybrid Jaya-Powell algorithm is proposed in this paper. Since the nonlinear dynamic system is complex with multi-dimension parameters, estimating parameters of the system can be considered as a muti-objective optimization task. The proposed Jaya-Powell algorithm combines the Jaya and Powell algorithm to search for the relatively global optimum and local optimum respectively, which offers a more accurate and effective estimation. The searching strategy of the proposed algorithm facilitates the balance of the exploration and exploitation in the optimization procedure. Due to no algorithm-specific parameters are required in the Jaya and Powell algorithm, the proposed Jaya-Powell can avoid deliberate fine-Tuning of corresponding parameters. To validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm in parameter estimation, the simulation of Lorenz chaotic system and comparative experiments are conducted. Seven algorithms, including Jaya algorithm, Powell algorithm, Teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), and cluster-chaotic-optimization algorithm (CCO), are considered as benchmarking algorithms in the comparison. The proposed hybrid Jaya-Powell algorithm outperforms seven benchmarking algorithms with the more accurate estimation and the relatively faster convergence. Based on the embedded system Raspberry pi 3, the proposed algorithm achieves the similar performance by comparing with the experiments conducted on the computer. The successful implementation via Raspberry pi 3 facilitates the application of the proposed algorithm in edge computing.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - The online experimentation is in expansion in Higher Education Institutions, with a dynamic extension to all scientific areas. The integration of online labs in higher educational courses constitutes a significant financial saving way for the institutions with multiple benefits for student's learning. Without access and usage time restrictions, these labs provide a wide range of experiments, performed individually or in groups, repeated as often as needed, without any space or time restrictions, just imposing the Internet access is available and in good conditions. This paper describes a use case application of a web platform that integrates, monitors and controls different technologies, such as Wireless Sensor Networks, Virtual Sensor Networks and Data Acquisition Boards, through an Internet accessible RESTful API, using low-cost devices such as the Raspberry Pi. In this context, a remote laboratory is developed for students programming in Python, based on such platform to improve their programming skills, overcome their difficulties in CS1 and CS2 courses, and give the ability to interact to physical world through practical examples.

N2  - In previous works, an educational platform based on Matlab/Simulink/Lego EV3 has been developed that allows interacting in real time with the robot. However, this platform is limited to the capacity of Simulink to adapt to different robotic devices, limiting its use to LEGO and Arduino or Rasberry Pi robots. In this paper we present a generalization of this platform to any type of robot, based on Matlab/ROS/Robot. Robot Operating System (ROS) is a robotic middleware, that is, a collection of frameworks for software development of robots [4]. Despite not being an operating system, ROS provides standard services such as hardware abstraction, control of low-level devices, etc. MATLAB support for ROS is a library of functions that allows you to exchange data with ROS-enabled physical robots. Matlab/ROS/Robot interaction is tested in a generic robot with Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi 3, demonstrating the viability of the presented educational robotic platform.

N2  - This paper presents an adaptive framework (web application) that supports secure, end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT) sensing architecture, which includes loosely coupled set of components with well-defined interfaces that can be adapted to a wide range of uses. Moreover, the framework was adopted in a Computer Science (CS) Fog computing course to get formal evaluation by undergraduate students. IoT has emerged as a new network paradigm, involving connecting physical world through sensors (temperature, humidity, intensity, etc.) to the Internet, to provide opportunities for building intelligent systems and applications. There are a few notable characteristics of todays IoT systems that serve as impediments for greater adoption. First, the common, well-documented platform that spans end-to-end, and which can cover a multitude of practical uses, is still missing. The second impediment is the lack of standard energy-efficient platform. Third, with the growing deployment of IoT devices, the attack vector for possible exploitation increases, which dictates an increase in the ongoing cost to ensure Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability triad. In this project, we propose the solution to address these impediments. The proposed framework makes it economical and easy to adapt to (e.g. to learn and to support). The next benefit comes with the use of environment harvesting equipment (solar cell, in-line hydro-generators, thermoelectric cells, etc.) and use of energy efficient coding methods, including security and communication provisions. Overall, the project successfully integrates Amazon Cloud technologies, Raspberry-Pi and Arduino embedded systems using energy-harvesting technologies, secure communication using government standards, and highly available network of nodes using wireless technology into a Cloud-of-Things (CoF).The methodology allows a myriad IoT devices connected to the Internet to be easily monitored and manipulated through the implemented web application. On the other hand, since few dedicated IoT courses are currently offered, most Science, technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students will have limited or no exposure to IoT development until after graduation, and inadequately prepared in IoT development to enter into the workforce. Therefore, the implemented framework was introduced in a CS special topic course to get comments and formal evaluations from undergraduate STEM students. An outline of a well-developed courseware is presented in the paper. The courseware is evaluated through survey questions. The majority of the students provided positive feedback and enjoyed the IoT framework.  2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - Due to the opportunities provided by the Internet, people are taking advantage of e-learning courses and enormous research efforts have been dedicated to the development of e-learning systems. So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we present an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We carried out some experiments with a student of our laboratory for brain waves and, encryption and decryption time of cipher algorithms. We used MindWave Mobile (MWM) to get the data. For experimental results, when using our system the concentration is 80 [%] from 0 [s] to 400 [s]. But, for 400 [s] to 1000 [s], concentration is decreased. In the case of not using our system, concentration is almost the same (about 40 [%]) from 0 [s] to 1000 [s]. From simulation results, we found that the decryption time is faster than encryption time, however for 3-DES and Raspberry Pi decryption time is higher than encryption time.

N2  - Current security and privacy solutions fail to meet the IoT requirements due to computational restrictions and portable nature of IoT objects. In this demo, a novel authentication framework is proposed that exploits the device-specific information to authenticate each object in the IoT. The framework is shown to effectively track the physical environment effects on objects. The experiment shows a sample IoT environment consisting of multiple Raspberry PI units operating as IoT objects. The proposed framework monitors the changes of the physical environment surrounding objects by examining the changes in the device-specific information of each IoT object. The scenario of an emulation attacker is presented in the demo as a case study. The attacker is capable of replicating all the transmitted messages and security keys of one of the IoT objects. Our proposed framework is able to effectively detect such an attack and improve the authentication accuracy for all IoT objects. Demo Abstract.  2017 ACM.

N2  - Purpose: For several decades, calligraphy has been popular among people in Japan, China, and even in the world. Traditionally, a teacher teaches how to write letters on a paper with a brush, and a student will imitate them by referring to the model letters. However, if a teacher is not available, this method will not be applicable either. This study aims to propose a calligraphy learning assistant system (CLAS) using projection mapping, which allows a student to learn calligraphy by him/herself. Design/methodology/approach: By following the letter writing video of a teacher that is directly projected on the paper, a student is able to learn the stroke order and writing speed in addition to the letter shape. Moreover, the letter portion practice function is incorporated in CLAS to allow a learner to repeat practicing hard portions of each letter. Findings: For evaluations, the authors implemented CLAS using Raspberry Pi and open-source software and asked students to use it. The results confirmed that CLAS is effective in improving calligraphy skills of novice students. Originality/value: With CLAS, a student can practice calligraphy using a conventional brush, ink and paper at a desk while looking at the model letter writing of a teacher projected on the paper using projection mapping.  2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Braille is an essential system of learning for visually challenged people. It is the method which enables them to read and write. The literacy rate in case of visually challenged people in many countries is very low. Various factors like lack of government initiatives, limitations of tutors, lack of personal attention etc. are the possible reasons for this state. Our project aims at developing a self-learning Braille kit which can help people with visual impairments. The solution aims at developing an easy to learn kit that will behave as a teacher and assists the visually challenged people for learning the Braille learning system. The designed system uses a Braille keypad and microphone to take input and produces speech as output. By implementing the designed system for visually challenged individuals, Braille literacy can be affected positively. The solution is so designed that it optimizes cost and speed of operation of the device.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - This paper aims the study of designing an English learning system for blind children. Instrument designed is interactive learning media so hopefully blind child will be easy to be interested and active to learn. The processing hardware used is Raspberry Pi (as its main brain). Learning system mode is made of two kinds, namely learning mode (text to speech method) and question mode (speech to text method). The result of this research is a model for learning letters recognition and English pronunciation tool. The design of this tool using Raspberry Pi 3, because the Raspberry Pi 3 is a computer system that is integrated with the supporting components required in voice recognition processing and text to voice conversion. The design of this model does not cost much, because it only uses a Mini PC that is Raspberry Pi 3 as the main component. However, in previous research, interactive learning of braille for children using linguistics requires a lot of hardware and requires teachers in its use. the learning media is expected to help the blind child in learning the characters and English words and also expected this instrument can be used for use in the school blind.

N2  - Traditional university level introductory programming classes are based upon a desktop based computing paradigm, emphasizing I/O based computations and user interface design. While certainly introducing important concepts, desktop based computing instruction misses a huge and vitally important aspect of computation, namely microprocessor based embedded systems. In this paper, we propose to replace desktop based instruction with a cheap, small, portable computing platform: the Raspberry Pi (RP). RP offers the best of both worlds and at the same time, offers the student to develop complete (and interesting) computing projects. Additionally, we discuss the ramifications on IT infrastructure and IT support resulting from incorporating RP into the computer science curriculum.  2017 IIMC / IST-Africa.

N2  - This paper describes some results of the FP7 CLEM project, Cloud E-learning for Mechatronics. An interesting development has been the creation of remote laboratories in the cloud. Learners can access such laboratories to help with their practical learning about mechatronics without need to set up laboratories at their own institutions. On the other hand the cloud infrastructure enables multiple laboratories to come together virtually to create an ecosystem for educators and learners. From such a system, educators can pick and mix materials to create suitable courses for their students. This means that learners can experience different types of devices and laboratories through the cloud. The paper provides an overview of the CLEM project, presenting results so far. In addition to the remote laboratories set up using a Raspberry Pi and Arduino microprocessor structure, this paper also presents information on the results of a survey and the development of static learning material. It also explains how a holistic e-learning experience can be obtained through use of static and dynamic material together with facilities for collaboration and innovation.  2013 IEEE.

A kit was assembled for around $130 while replicating the educational functionality of a typical laboratory station in a university controls laboratory. This kit could also replace expensive equipment with an affordable alternative that can be easily shipped anywhere in the world and used by students with any computer. This greatly enhances the accessibility of the laboratory experience to students in budget-strapped campus laboratories and those participating in distance education. The kit design consists of a Raspberry Pi, a DC motor, and various components required for the lab exercises. The first two kits allow students to complete labs that include DC motor system identification, DC motor control, inverted pendulum control, and any other project a student might want to create with a Raspberry Pi, DC motor, and a 3-D printer.

N2  - This article presents a practical application of the Kalman filter by implementing a sensor array in a Bebop Parrot drone in order to detect objects within a determined rank to reduce the background noise in the obtained measurements. The effect of the relationship between the measurement taken by the sensors and the effectiveness of the background noise reduction using the Kalman filter was studied, thus reducing the variation of the sensor measurement. The objective of this implementation can help improve the teaching of the application of Kalman filter. Information readings are performed by the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors connected to the data acquisition board Arduino Yun, which interprets the electronic pulses to get the distance in meters and, at the same time, send them via serial port to a Raspberry Pi board; this board implements the Kalman filter sending the data via Wi-Fi to a computer connected to the network that allows visualizing the results of measurements and filter performance. The results obtained show the improvement of the data measurement by the distance sensors with the purpose of providing the drone with greater accuracy of data acquisition.

N2  - Camera networks are resource-constrained distributed systems that communicate over (wireless) networks to make decisions collaboratively. For surveillance applications, these camera nodes take decisions about an object of interest within incoming videos by coordinating with neighboring nodes, which is a costly process in terms of both time and energy. Datacompression methods can bring significant energy savings in camera nodes while transmitting or storing data in the network. Signal representation using sparse approximations and overcomplete dictionaries have received considerable attention in recent years and have been shown to outperform traditional compression methods. However, distributed dictionary learning itself relies on consensus-building algorithms, which involve communicating with neighboring nodes until convergence is achieved. To this end, we design a novel protocol to enable energy-efficient and robust dictionary learning in distributed camera networks by leveraging the spatial correlation of collected multimedia data. We employ low-computational-complexity metrics to quantify the correlation across cameras nodes. We also present a feasibility study of the parameters of the network that impact the performance of distributed dictionary learning and consensus process in terms of accuracy of the algorithm and energy consumed by the camera nodes. The performance of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulations using a network simulator and public datasets as well as via real-world experiments on a testbed of Raspberry Pi nodes.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Aeroengine simulation technology plays an important role in the development of advanced aeroengines. It can assist the engine design, shorten the development cycle, and help to reduce the research expense. Aeroengine simulation platform is widely used, especially in the field of aerospace engineering education. Digital simulation is mainly used to validate the initial test of the control algorithm, but the effectiveness of the simulation results is somewhat limited and can not be used as a final reference. As opposed to digital simulation, the traditional aeroengine hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is a high confidence method in the control algorithm test, but it is bulky, expensive and not easy to maintain, so it is an urgent need to develop an embedded, miniaturized, and economic HIL simulation platform for the purpose of engineering education. The embedded HIL simulation platform proposed in this paper is based on two kinds of open source hardware: Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The Raspberry Pi will operate as an engine model and the Arduino board will function as the controller. They exchange data through the built-in serial ports. Efficient C codes of the aeroengine model are generated using Real-Time Workshop (RTW) tool. Numerical simulation illustrates the potential of this economical solution in university engineering education.  2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

N2  - In this paper, we present the development of new course modules in the field of embedded systems, dedicated to teaching students about the internet-of-things. We discuss important issues in creating hands-on labs for students in such a course, along with the experience of teaching this course at the graduate level. We expect other instructors interested in this area to benefit from our experience. We also offer suggestions for adapting this course at the undergraduate level. Our main finding is that students are very excited to learn about cutting-edge technologies, including fast growing programming languages and platforms. Specific hands-on laboratory exercises were developed on the Raspberry Pi platform in Python to teach students about the end-to-end processing involved in acquiring, analyzing, storing and transmitting temperature sensor data. These lab exercises provided students with a detailed understanding of the end-to-end processing involved in internet-of-things applications, including sensory data acquisition, storage, transmission, retrieval and analytics. The lab exercises made the course material accessible and engaging. This addresses one of the barriers to students entering and staying in STEM fields, which is the perceived dullness of the material taught.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - A web controlled and partially autonomous vehicle system is presented in this paper. It highlights the idea to develop a remote controlled car which can be driven from anywhere using internet over a secured server. This car will also have limited automation features like traffic light detection, obstacle avoidance system and lane detection system so that it can drive itself safely in case of connectivity failure. The main goal here is to minimize the risk of human life and ensure highest safety during driving. At the same time the car will assure comfort and convenience to the controller. A miniature car including the above features has been developed which showed optimum performance in a simulated environment. The system mainly consists of a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, a Picamera, a sonar module, a web interface and internet modem. The Raspberry Pi was mainly used for the Computer Vision algorithms and for streaming video through internet. The proposed system is very cheap and very efficient in terms of automation.

N2  - The introduction of vehicle automation, autonomy and connectivity is fundamentally changing the concept of automotive transportation. Although many of these technologies are still in development in lab, some of these technologies are already available and demonstrated by the prototypes such as Google and Toyota self-driving cars. To prepare for the future workforce needs of autonomous vehicles in the automotive industry, we develop new, technologically progressive curricula and hands-on lab as well as student project materials. This proposed "Lane Keeping System by Visual Technology" is a research and concept-proving student project that will be studied and used to develop teaching materials for the subject of vehicle automation, autonomy and connectivity. Lane Keeping System (LKS) is an advanced active safety system, which uses a front-view camera to detect lane lines and distinguish lateral deviation. It will alert drivers when there is unintentional departure from the driving lane, and then actively steer the vehicle back into the driving lane. Vehicles not connected to the infrastructure do not have real time information of their lane position on the road. A visual identification system using a camera is therefore fundamental for a vehicle to obtain the traffic information. In this student project, a webcam and a microcomputer (Raspberry Pi) are connected and mounted on a previously developed modified RC toy car where the car movements are controlled by an Arduino. The obtained images in front of the car are processed by the OpenCV software. The current goal is to identify the horizon line, the roadside lines, and vertical roadside building lines from the images and then drive the car in the "middle" of the road. The test takes place in a long hall way and the RC toy car is able to stay in the middle when moving along the hallway automatically. Student working processes of design, hardware modification, as well as the algorithm and coding procedures are presented. The project activities, the testing results, and student's learning experiences and outcomes are present in this paper.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

N2  - Ambient intelligence (AmI) deals with a new world of ubiquitous computing devices, where physical environments interact intelligently and unobtrusively with people. AmI environments can be diverse, such as homes, offices, meeting rooms, schools, hospitals, control centers, vehicles, tourist attractions, stores, sports facilities, and music devices. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a testbed for AmI using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian OS. We analyze the performance of mean shift clustering algorithm considering sensing data. For evaluation we considered respiratory rate and heart rate metrics. The simulation results show that the mean shift clustering algorithm has a good performance.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Duckietown is an open, inexpensive and flexible platform for autonomy education and research. The platform comprises small autonomous vehicles ('Duckiebots') built from off-the-shelf components, and cities ('Duckietowns') complete with roads, signage, traffic lights, obstacles, and citizens (duckies) in need of transportation. The Duckietown platform offers a wide range of functionalities at a low cost. Duckiebots sense the world with only one monocular camera and perform all processing onboard with a Raspberry Pi 2, yet are able to: follow lanes while avoiding obstacles, pedestrians (duckies) and other Duckiebots, localize within a global map, navigate a city, and coordinate with other Duckiebots to avoid collisions. Duckietown is a useful tool since educators and researchers can save money and time by not having to develop all of the necessary supporting infrastructure and capabilities. All materials are available as open source, and the hope is that others in the community will adopt the platform for education and research.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Robotics and computational thinking are valuable tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy, and to promote inclusion and integration of students. We currently have a multitude of robotic education tools at our disposal. These tools arise with the aim of promoting innovation and student motivation during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our society today. Therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our everyday life. This work is focused on presenting Raspberry Pi as enhancer of educational robotics. The first step is presenting robotics as a tool for promoting the inclusion and integration of students. For this work a background and overview is also provided. The third part proposed different setups to prepare a Raspberry Pi for remote activities and robotics using Arduino as hardware interface. The last but not the least is an open discussion with the aim of exchanging impressions and getting feedback from the attendees.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In last two decades, virtual laboratories help to teach students and train technicians in a broad range of engineering areas including automation and control. However, there is still a lack of laboratories that present more complex control schemes directly related to industrial problems. In this paper, new virtual laboratories presenting feedback and feedforward vibration damping techniques are described. Thanks to the automatic code generation, the presented algorithms are directly deployable to various real-time platforms suitable for teaching/training or professional industrial applications ranging from industrial PCs towards deep embedded boards like Raspberry Pi. The interactive tools are freely accessible at www.ContLab.eu. The authors believe that those virtual labs may be useful for both academic and industrial sphere.  IFAC.

N2  - There has been a growing interest and increase in work shared about national K-12 Computer Science Education (CSED) curriculum and implementation efforts around the world. Much of this work focuses on curriculum analysis, country reports, experience reports and case studies. The K-12 CSED community would benefit from an international strategic effort to compare, contrast and monitor K-12 CSED over time, across multiple countries and regions, to understand pedagogy, practice, resources and experiences from the perspective of teachers working in classrooms. Furthermore, there is a need for validated and robust instruments that can support comparable investigations into the current state of K-12 CSED in schools around the world. Through a collaborative effort, this Working Group will develop a validated teacher survey instrument and collect data about CSED implementation and practice in K-12 classrooms. The authors will pilot the survey with K-12 teacher cohorts and analyse, compare and contrast survey findings across countries.  2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - The falling costs of battery storage and photovoltaic systems have substantially increased the number of "solar-plus-battery" installations in homes and buildings. The solar-plus-battery system enables homeowners to protect their homes during a power outage and save on their electricity bills by stacking multiple value streams that battery storage can provide. In this paper, we present EnergyBoost, a system that proactively controls battery charge and discharge operations, and investigate whether it makes sense economically to install a battery controlled by this system in different jurisdictions with distinct tariff structures. EnergyBoost solves an optimal control problem over a finite time horizon relying on physical models of a solar inverter and a lithium-ion battery, and supervised learning models for predicting the next day available solar energy and household demand. We propose two learning-based control algorithms for EnergyBoost, namely model predictive control and advantage actor-critic. We implement these algorithms on a Raspberry Pi and compare their performance with a rule-based controller under various pricing schemes using real traces of solar irradiance and power consumption of 70 homes located in the same jurisdiction. Our results indicate that EnergyBoost's control policy outperforms the baseline policies in terms of reducing the average monthly electricity bill, yielding a bill that is, on average, only 7.6% worse than the best bill that can be theoretically achieved.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

The use of remote experiment can aid in this learning process reducing difficulties and shortcomings related to the lack experimentation and interaction with phenomenonthat occur in traditional classes. This paper reports on the use of a remote experiment used for students learning about material elastic properties (Hook's Law). The experiment in this paper is composed of: a helical spring coupled to a didactic press, a Raspberry Pi controller, a local server and a Website for accessing educational content and controlling the experiment. The learning environment also allows access through mobile devices. During the experiment, charts and parameter tables are displayed on the screen. These data are sourceof informationfor students calculating and analyzing the phenomenon observed, relating theory to practice.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - Within the later stages of many Electronics or Computer Science degree programmes it is common to cover the programming of real-time systems, sometimes with an embedded orientation, instructing students in the fundamentals and application of multitasking and multithreading. Within this paper we detail the approach taken at Glasgow Caledonian University in the design of such a module as part of a programme in Computer and Electronic Systems Engineering. In particular we explain how we structure laboratory exercises to reflect the typical industrial design practice of partitioning systems into application layer and presentation layer - utilising QNXTM RTOS for application, integrated with open-source Qt for presentation and human interaction. The target application is based on a simple automotive dashboard executing on the Beagleboard-xM platform. The approach is shown to raise student interest and understanding of embedded application-building using highly productive toolsets.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents a robot-Visual Programming Environment (VPE) interface that can support K-12 students to learn science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) concepts. Specifically, we employ Google's Blockly VPE to construct a blocks-based visual programming tool to facilitate easy programming of and interaction with physical robots. Through a careful and intentional integration of the Blockly VPE and physical robots, we illustrate that many K-12 level STEM concepts, which are traditionally treated through lectures and problem-solving, can be explored in a hands-on manner. The use of Blockly VPE obviates the need for prior experience with computer programming or familiarity with advanced programming concepts. Moreover, it permits students to learn various programming constructs, sequentially, starting from the fundamentals and gradually progressing to advanced concepts. The web-based Blockly VPE provides an interface that allows the user to browse through a block library and construct a block code for which a corresponding C program is automatically generated. The default web-based Blockly interface has been modified to permit the user to edit the resulting C program or to create an entirely new C program. Moreover, the Blockly VPE allows the user to wirelessly upload the C program to a Linux server running on a Raspberry Pi computer hosted on the robot. The Raspberry Pi compiles the received C program and serially transfers corresponding instructions to the robot's embedded hardware. The efficacy of the proposed robot-VPE interface is examined through students' experiences in conducting several illustrative robot-based STEM learning activities. The results of content quizzes and surveys show gains in students' understanding of STEM concepts after participation in robotics activities with the VPE interface.  2016 ACM.

N2  - Understanding, promoting, and teaching media literacy is an important societal challenge. STEM educators are increasingly looking to incorporate 21st century skills such as media literacy into core subject education. In this paper we investigate how undergraduate Computer Science (CS) students can learn media literacy as a by-product of collaborative video tutorial production. The paper presents a study of 34 third-year CS undergraduates who, as part of their learning, were each asked to produce three video tutorials on Raspberry Pi programming, using a collaborative video production tool for mobile phones (Bootlegger). We provide results of both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the production process and resulting video tutorials, and conclude that the student cohort demonstrated a clear development of media literacy skills. The paper's contribution is twofold. First, we add to the understanding of how the use of mobile collaborative video production technology by non-professionals can help them learn to create meaningful media messages with little scaffolding. Second, we present an alternative pedagogical approach that can help CS students acquire 21st century skills such as media literacy.

N2  - Braille is a standard code for people with visual disabilities that consists of an array of high points. This paper explains the implementation of a low-cost prototype for reading, writing, and audio-Assisted evaluation. This didactic and user-friendly system aims to improve the learning of disabled people by providing teachers new and modern alternatives to lead and monitor the student's activities. For designing the prototype, the researchers followed the suggestions provided by teachers of the 'Mariana de Jesus' institute for blind and deaf children. The Braille Grade 1 system consists of the following four stages: (a) writing, by the use of 10 buttons placed in matrix form, (b) reading, through 10 push-pull solenoids, (c) memorization, and (d) evaluation by using a touch display where the generated letters are displayed and assisted by audio messages. The implementation was carried out using a Raspberry Pi 3B board due to its high performance and low cost. The device improves and eases learning of Braille grade 1, allowing the monitoring of the progress reached, with and an acceptance of 91% obtained from the teachers of the institute.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, we present an inoculated combination of technologies to facilitate and advocate education in Rural India. A combination of open-sourced Arduino, single board-processors like Raspberry Pi are used to develop infrastructure to empower education in remote and rural parts of India. Being a self-contained system, the dependencies on external factors is reduced as it might not be possible to operate regular computers without grid-connected supply. The whole system is powered using renewable energy (RE) source viz., Solar PV. This implies that the system is an independent green computing device. Further, this enables commerce while augmenting education facilities for the underserved population residing in remote and rural areas where energy is still a challenge today. The Ardunio is used to perform various systemic operations like motioning the load, calculating the ambient light etc. The Raspberry Pi is the core processor unit of the system which typically acts like a computer that runs on a Linux-based Kernel Operating System (OS). The System-on-Chip (SoC) is then connected to a HDMI display periphery hub which switched between multiple displays. The supply to all of this sub-system is powered by a Solar PV. A charge control is implemented to overlook the charging process of the storage battery.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - This paper aims to propose a short course with a commercial off the shelf unmanned aerial vehicle (COTS UAV) system. From the short course, students can have a conception of a UAV system, and they would have not only the knowledge about the hardware integration but also the theoretical background of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) and the situation awareness system. The proposed course consists of two parts; the GNC system for holding the position and the situation awareness system with the marker detection and tracking. A Pixhawk is selected for a flight controller with an open source autopilot, i.e. px 4, and a Raspberry Pi with a downward camera is utilised for the visual navigation of the situation awareness system. The Pixhawk and Raspberry Pi are integrated into the robot operating system (ROS) via the WIFI network, and the MAVROS is adopted for the communication between the Pixhawk and the Raspberry Pi. The first part of the course is designed as the hands-on based lectures, and the second part of the course is adopted the problem-based project. Copyright  2019. The Authors.

N2  - Computer education is in the midst of a major transformation as a result of the rapid emergence of new technologies, intersection of computing with other disciplines and growing interest among students in computing courses. Such transformation prompted educators to redefine the way computing education is delivered and experiment a wide range of learning approaches. One of these approaches is the integration of hardware prototyping platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Intel Internet of Things as part of project-based learning. These platforms have become in recent years instrumental tools for improving students' learning process and promoting proactive thinking. The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of integrating low cost open-source hardware platforms into engineering and computer science courses. In particular, we explore the use of an experiential learning approach using these kits for improving the students' learning experience in computer science and engineering courses. Throughout this paper, we discuss the outcome of our investigation and provide insights on how to make classrooms more experiential using the hardware prototyping paradigm.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - We present a new interdisciplinary educational program in multifunctional robotics built around three versatile vehicles  a mobile inverted pendulum (BeagleMiP), a four-wheelsteerable rover (BeagleRover), and a quadrotor (BeagleQuad)  all built around the TI BeagleBone Black (BBB), together with a new printed circuit connector board, or "cape", designed specifically for multifunctional robotics applications. The program is coupled with a C library of key robotics functions, together with working example codes and educational materials, making it exceptionally easy to get started, and to extend. Volume 1 of the program targets embedded control  robotics education at the "maker" level, and is easily accessible in high schools and beyond. Building directly on Volume 1, Volume 2 of the program targets the "professional" level, building on knowledge of ODEs, dynamics, control theory, and op amps, and is useful in senior-level college capstone courses  industry. Prototype versions of BeagleMiP were used by the authors during the last three offerings of UCSDs fall-quarter senior-level Embedded Control  Robotics course. The electronics used have evolved from an Arduino Nano and various small development boards, assembled on an 830-point solderless breadboard, to the powerful $50 BBB paired with our highly extensible robotics cape, which incorporates the commonly-needed additional electronics for many robotics applications, including an IMU, barometer, battery management, H-bridges, real-time clock with battery backup, and over a dozen convenient connectors, into a very small footprint. The best-practices programming techniques fostered by this program implement an advanced software architecture written in C, with different threads running at different loop rates and priorities. The resulting educational program will be commercially available soon, marketed in partnership with WowWee Robotics.  2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. All Rights Reserved.

N2  - Agriculture plays a major role in the nations economic contribution. The source of income and livelihood of around 70% of Indian population depends on agriculture. Harvest and post-harvest losses due to many reasons lead to heavy financial burden to farmers as well as Government. Though many agriculture security measures, like crop insurance, are provided to farmers by Government, still the farmers suicide is a common phenomenon. To minimize the crop loss during harvest or post-harvest, this paper proposes the smart agriculture system with the help of Internet of Things (IoT). With the use of several sensors and Raspberry Pi, different models are proposed for supervision of soil moisture and pests, building intelligent seeds corporation and efficient food corporation of India.

N2  - This paper presents an international study of K-12 Computer Science implementation across Australia, England, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Scotland and the United States. We present findings from a pilot study, comparing CS curriculum requirements (intended curriculum) captured through country reports, with what surveyed teachers (n=244) identify as enacting in their classroom (the enacted curriculum). We address the extent that teachers are implementing the intended curriculum as enacted curriculum, exploring specifically country differences in terms of programming languages and CS topics implemented. Our findings highlight the similarities and differences of intended and enacted CS curriculum within and across countries and the value of such comparisons.  2019 ACM.

N2  - The goal of Internet-of-Things (IoT) is that every object across the globe be interconnected under the Internet Infrastructure. IoT is expanding its application domain to range from environmental monitoring to industrial automation thereby leading to vast research challenges. Vast presence of devices in the Internet has increased the possible challenges faced by devices and data. The devices communicate on a public channel that is more likely to be accessed by unauthorized users and disturb the privacy of genuine users. The existing solutions that ensure data authenticity and user privacy, use MD5 and SHA-family of hashing algorithms under digital signature schemes. These algorithms create a trade-off between the security concern and energy consumption of IoT devices. To provide an energy efficient authentication method, we propose a customized BLAKE2b hashing algorithm with modified elliptic curve digital signature scheme (ECDSA). The parameters considered for the evaluation of the proposed methods are signature generation time, signature verification time and hashing time. The experiments are conducted under client server model using Raspberry Pi-3. The proposed method has shown about 0.71.91% improvement in the signature generation time and 7.679.13 % improvement in signature verification time when compared with BLAKE2b based signature generation/verification. The proposed method is resistant to Man-in-the-Middle attack, Distributed DoS attack (DDoS), pre-image resistance, second pre-image resistance and collision resistance. Based on the performance obtained by the experiments, it can be inferred that the proposed scheme is feasible for resource-constrained IoT devices.  2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - In this paper, we present a cost effective approach to remote experimentation. We propose ArPi Lab - remote laboratory for education in area of process control. This lab is built on very cheap hardware components, including single-board computers Raspberry Pi and open prototyping platforms Arduino based on 8-bit micro-controllers. This approach combines several different software technologies. These are HTML 5 and JavaScript for client-side application, PHP and MySQL for laboratory server implementation, JSON as structure for data transfer, and C language for experiment server and micro-controller programming. ArPi Lab provides three different types of educational physical systems. Three thermal plants, one magnetic levitation, and one hydraulic tank system are available for remote laboratory experiments. Each part of ArPi Lab's hardware architecture can be controlled in the meaning of power supply. For this purpose we propose an efficient power management model, designed to solve occasional hardware and communication failures in such kind of laboratories, where physical absence of supervising person can result in serious malfunctions or security issues.

N2  - This paper is on free and open source software architecture (FOSS) for remote labs in order to address the affordability and scalability of robotic education technology for sustainable deployments. The proposed Raspberry Pi-Arduino-based model architecture ensures lower cost while allowing some scalability, interoperability, portability and interchangeability to the low-cost online laboratory. Remotely controlled lab provides training skills in bio-inspired robotics. Our previous studies had shown that the implementation of remotely controlled online labs in the curriculum improved active learning among students, collaboration, and augmented problem solving skills. The preliminary implementation involved proprietary software, as the remote experiment accessibility platform, which was later replaced with FOSS technology. The advantages with FOSS included a significantly lower cost and scalability for concurrent usage. The paper also reports on usage analysis and common issues in both cases of implementations.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - This paper considers the use of a blocks-based visual environment to demonstrate and teach robot-programming to K-12 students. A visual programming environment is built using the open-source, JavaScript-based, Blockly library developed by Google. For illustrative purposes, we employ a low-cost, single-board computer, such as Raspberry Pi, with embedded microcontrollers, such as Brick Pi for LEGO or Arduino UNO. Two mobile robot forms are created for experimentation, a wheeled mobile robot and a two legged mobile robot. To command and control each mobile robot, the developed visual tool employs blocks corresponding to basic programming constructs such as loops, conditional statements, variables, and procedures. To demonstrate the ease, education, and fun value of our approach, a maze-based educational game has been developed. Specifically, the game requires the user to program a robot through our visual tool to navigate the maze and score points that are distributed throughout the maze.  2018 American Society for Engineering Education.

N2  - Laboratory experiments are vital component of engineering education. In recent years, significant interest and shift of paradigm from in-class to online teaching is observed which although offers many benefits but poses a great challenge to integrate lab experiments into online courses and degree programs. Internet-based laboratories are a potential solution to address this challenge and to meet required course level outcomes for distant learning students. This paper discusses the design and development of a novel low-cost remote laboratory system and associated experiments designed for introductory level as well as advanced learners of photovoltaics and renewable energy courses. The hardware setup consists of an integrated source-measure unit, LED array illumination system, and interconnection electronics controlled by an embedded Python program running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Measurement multiplexing approach allows multiple users to access the system and perform real-time experiments at the same time. The system communicates to a remote computer through google APIs and therefore can work under any wifi environment or even cellular network connections without the hassle and complexity of hosting a local server. Users can remotely access the system, perform experiments and acquire experimental data through a graphical user interface developed using Visual C#. The user-end program is made freely available to students and is currently patent pending. The paper details the hardware setup, software interface, discusses the designed experiments and future prospects.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2019

N2  - This paper presents a course project assignment in an upper-division engineering course: Controls and Optimizations. Students were divided into groups to build robots which are capable of navigating autonomously indoors. It is a perfect vehicle to integrate electrical, computer, and mechanical knowledge into a mechatronics system. In particular, after the mechanical and electrical design were finished, the students wrote control software to use feedback from ultrasonic sensors and Wi-Fi modules to enable autonomous operation. Each powered by a Raspberry Pi, the robots competed against each other autonomously to play an indoor Bocce game. The jack of the game was a wireless router, and the goal of the robots was to get as close to the jack as possible while not hitting any obstacles. This project and the Bocce game also have practical implications in real-world applications. For example, robots with similar capabilities may be able to rescue people who carry wireless device, to navigate in factories or warehouses to retrieve items, and to lead customers to certain items in supermarkets. In this paper, we will present the electrical, mechanical, and software design of the winning team of the Bocce game. The bill of materials and details of the Bocce game will also be included. On the educational front, we discuss a couple of efforts we made to help the students build, program, and test the robots: (i) we design an introductory LAB to introduce Raspberry Pi to our students and (ii) we utilize project-based learning techniques to encourage the students to learn new things along the way.

N2  - This paper sets out the methods and the technologies used to design a captive portal to redirect users to the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of a course taking place in a given room. The captive portal is designed on a Raspberry Pi 2 carrying an Apache HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) server and using iptables for redirections. It has a web configuration interface, developed with AngularJS, which communicates through HTTP request to the server side, developed in PHP, following the principle of a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) architecture. In addition to redirect users to the URL of a course, the interface is configurable in two modes: (1) fixed URL that sets an URL to which the user is redirected automatically, (2) hosting a local website which is used to load a web site in zip format on the device and then redirect users to this web site even when the device is not connected to any Ethernet network.

N2  - Asian students with conservative behaviors tend to feel embarrassed and reluctant to ask questions in large classrooms. This paper proposed a mobile-compatible web-based question and answer application to address the aforementioned problem. This proposed web application is known as Quick Question (QQ). QQ is designed to allow students to post questions anonymously and rapidly during class hours. QQ can be accessed online from a web hosting server, or offline from a Raspberry Pi without Internet access. QQ can run on multiple platforms with different screen sizes and capable of serving 250 concurrent users while using the Raspberry Pi. QQ also includes a profanity filter that censor bad words with an accuracy of 86.11%. Furthermore, a term extraction and learning mechanism is implemented to help in grouping and sorting questions posted by students in a class.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - As a field, engineering is a profession with rich and deep theoretical foundations in each of its numerous subject areas. Helping students understand these foundational theoretical concepts can sometimes be difficult, and it is not uncommon for students to "get lost" in the details and fail to understand the main concepts. One way to help overcome this problem is to use laboratory classes. Laboratory classes provide students with hands-on learning experiences that help them connect theory and practice. One way students do this is by running experiments, collecting data, analyzing it, and comparing the results to those predicted by theoretical models. This discovery process can help build students' confidence in existing theories and help them understand these theories at a much deeper level. Although this sounds great, the reality for students in many engineering programs is different. Laboratory equipment is expensive, and even in relatively small laboratory classes (such as one with a dozen students), equipment can be overbooked. Although one or two students may get to run the equipment themselves, the rest may not get those experiences and don't benefit in the same way as the students who did. This is the exact situation the author faced with a materials science lab course. The bottleneck in this case was the tensile testing machine, and feedback from students about the class included the fact that much of their lab time was spent "sitting around" while they waited to be able to use the (one and only) tensile testing machine. To address this problem, we developed a small low-cost tensile testing machine so that students could eventually work concurrently in groups of 2 or 3, each with their own tensile testing machine. The current tensile testing machine prototype has a crosshead with 18in of vertical travel and replaceable load cells of 5kg(11lb) to 500kg (1100lb). This prototype uses a dual leadscrew with a hand crank, an optical encoder to measure distance, a load cell to measure force, and a small 7" monitor to display the results in real time to the user. An Arduino board is used for data acquisition from the encoder and load cell, and this is connected to a Raspberry Pi computer, which is in turn connected to the monitor. A wireless keyboard with an integrated track pad was used to interface with the machine, whose output is shown on the small 7" monitor.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

N2  - With every increasing integrated circuit manufacturing prowess, today an astounding array of devices include embedded microcontrollers to provide connectivity, automation, power efficiency along with entertainment to end user. One example is the widely used light bulbs. They first became LEDs and then miniature controllers were added that can be programmed using a cell phone remotely. The widely known term smart device really comes from embedded microcontrollers in majority of the devices. Silicon manufactures have launched hobby industries around inexpensive electronics, particularly microprocessor boards, with more capabilities and easy to program systems such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino. For individual developer or capable consumer those devices offer vast levels of customization. When electrical and computer engineers are trained, it is imperative that nearly all acquire some level of exposure to embedded microcontroller and associated software development skills to effectively function as engineers in their careers. The nature of work performed in industry changes as they progress in careers. Lack of such exposure and experience will constrain their opportunities in different technical fields and even managerial advancements. At this university, electrical engineering and computer engineering majors take one semester course in microcontrollers to learn embedded system developments in their junior year preceded by a C programming course and an electronics course. This course facilitates their understanding of digital controllers and most of the senior capstone projects would select one or two microcontrollers as the heart of the project. Students have used Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Freescale Dragon boards which the course and labs are based on due to its simplicity and legacy. With vast processing capabilities of electronics, Google and others are trying to push automation to a new degree with self-driving vehicles which have to read and interpret moving and stationary objects, black and white surface lines, light colors, etc. To provide more hands on experience and a flavor of such real world emerging technologies, the author recently introduced an automated vehicle project to students in lieu of the final written comprehensive assessment for the Embedded Systems course. This paper discusses the content and experience in having an automated line tracking and moving object avoidance project as final class assessment in Embedded Systems class. The project is to be done by two student groups with limited skeleton code and help from the instructor within a few weeks' time toward end of the course. Students mount Dragon 12 microcontroller boards on cars after removing remote controller units, but leaving the motors intact. Some use 4-wheel drive cars and separate driver circuits along with sonar sensors, sound sensors and line sensors. Students learn to be creative and sharpen their engineering skills. Instructor evaluates the devices on a track shown to them on paper, but not made available for trials. The track contains left-right curves, cross roads, and moving objects are used to test their vehicles in front of an audience.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

N2  - This paper describes the development of indoor monitoring system based on UHF RFID system and raspberry Pi 3. An algorithm is developed to link the UHF RFID reader module to the Raspberry Pi 3, send the data received to a database via wireless network, and display the data on a user interface module. To determine the best RFID tag for the system, the performance of two UHF RFID tags, UPM DogBone and AZ-9640 is held. The result is collected and tabulated, and it can be concluded that UPM DogBone shows better performance BECAUSE the size of the antenna is bigger than that of AZ-9640.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The project that needed to be finished was designing the controlling part of a cleaning machine. This paper planned to design a smart controlling system of a cleaning machine. The aim was to design the controlling part so that it could realize controlling the motor rotating into different direction when it reached a per-set position. The biggest problem for a small closed cleaning machine is how to dealing with the dust after working, which will influence the efficient and service life of the machine. The main parts for a cleaning machine are working space and cleaning system. Hand-operated was adapted widely before. However, it wasted a lot of time and had a low efficiency. Many studies focus on how to handle the problem more intelligently and efficient by using automatic controlling model. This report presented using raspberry pi as the main part in the controlling system basing on the comprehensive advantages. It provides support for Python as the main programming language, which is convenient for people to learn. It could be connected with a display screen directly to realize the functions like a computer, which ensure the debug process could be done at any time. A whole system combining Hall sensor, DC motor and raspberry pi was designed to realize the final aim of the controlling part according to the preparation of previous experiments. A simulation of the effect of this system was also done to simulate the real working condition and to detect whether the system would work well in the real condition.

N2  - A team of leading UK space companies, in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, created the Astro Pi project (www.astro-pi.org) in order to exploit the outreach possibilities offered by the flight of British ESA Astronaut Tim Peake to the ISS between December 2015 and June 2016. The activities related to this project are intended to encourage and strengthen the teaching of the science, mathematics, engineering, computing and coding curriculums, and through this stimulate the curiosity of students and motivate them towards further study of STEM subjects. At the core of the Project is the Astro Pi Payload which was not only developed to be taken to the ISS, but also into classrooms and used by students. It consists of a Raspberry Pi B+ computer, an add-on board called the Sense HAT, a digital camera and six push buttons. The Sense HAT board was designed to host a variety of sensors and input/output devices that are useful for experiments aboard the ISS and in the classroom. The payload was qualified for spaceflight in 2015 and, in parallel, a competition was run to promote engagement between schools and the UK space industry that was supported by a broad range of learning resources. The payload was launched into space on the Orbital ATK OA-4 Cygnus cargo freighter in December 2015 and the winning experiments were executed aboard the ISS by Tim Peake in early 2016. These generated a wide range of interesting results and earth observation images for the schools to analyse on the ground. Between February and March 2016 a second competition was run to further promote school engagement with the UK space industry. This differed from the 2015 competition, where students were given an open-ended brief, by posing specific challenges that must be met with code. The prize was the same, to have their code uploaded and run on the Astro Pi payload by Tim Peake. This paper is divided into four sections. The first provides detail of the Cygnus launch and flight operations aboard the ISS; the second reviews the results of the first competition and how these were distributed and analysed by the schools; the third is dedicated to ongoing outreach events and the establishment of a long term legacy for Astro Pi and the fourth covers the second, challenge based, competition including its results, impact and engagement, dissemination of teaching resources, evaluation process, and lessons learned.

N2  - The development of open-architecture humanoid robot controller for developmental disability (DD) rehabilitation, substituting the manufacturer controller is presented. This proposed architecture controller is made open to provide the knowledge of all the control structures as well as allow the developers to modify all the controller layers. The proposed open-architecture controller has four important layers, which are Task Layer, Integration Layer, Communication Layer and Physical Layer which will be explained further in this paper. The open-architecture controller was developed with a Raspberry Pi 2 using Python programming language along with other additional modules and peripherals to increase the robot's performance. A serial communication circuit is constructed to create the communication bridge between the humanoid robot's motors and proposed controller. The experimental results showed that the proposed open-architecture controller presented several advantages over the conventional controller. Despite that, further research works are necessary since the open-architecture humanoid robot controller is yet an on-going project in producing a robust open-architecture controller which consequently will further enhance the humanoid robot development and performance.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are highly multidisciplinary systems that involve disciplines such as embedded computing, control theory and communication technology. Even though building this kind of systems is a challenging task, its introduction during the last courses of computer science and engineering university degrees has proven very valuable to teach students to deal with complexity. This paper presents an educational experience in the field of Computer Science at the University College of Engineering of Vitoria-Gasteiz (UPV/EHU). As part of an elective course, students had to design and develop an Android-based remote control system for teleoperating an educative mobile robot controlled by means of a Raspberry Pi. They had to apply and combine concepts learnt in previous disciplines (such as programming, operating systems or communication networks), reinforcing already acquired skills, as well as gaining other generic skills demanded in their future professional career, such as: (1) effectively working in groups, (2) integrating different technologies, (3) proactive problem solving, or (4) coping with system complexity.

N2  - In long duration emergency and large scale disaster situations, information on asset position, information of current and information history of weather conditions, and communication are crucial for every rescue operation. Picture and voice are crucial so that affected population can make important decisions and take actions. Available technology offers affordable (low cost) and robust infrastructure solutions in disaster relief situations supported by radio amateur communication. In this paper we presented three types of services for which same hardware in essence can be used. First service is for GPS location mapping, second one is for VOIP communication, and third one is to provide real time video capturing. GPS location mapping was performed by using APRS-IS SDR, VOIP communication is performed via radio-svxlink-Internet using Echolink (svxlink which is linux compatible version) software, and for video capturing was used using Motion software. All above stated services is possible to install on low energy microcomputer such as Raspberry Pi which can be powered with 5 V battery or with mobile phone power adapter.  2015 MIPRO.

N2  - Object tracking system is a system that can detect pre-defined object from frame to frame in a sequence automatically. In this research, the system is designed for supporting multimedia conferencing system for distance learning. Viola-Jones algorithm is used mainly related to relative simplicity, execution speed, and minimum memory requirement for image processing. The development of the algorithm is done by adding a template matching feature when Viola-Jones fails to detect the face area. With a fairly simple function, this algorithm can be used on system with low computing power processor, one of them is Odroid C2. In this research, an object tracking device is developed and featured with a pan and tilt bracket camera drive with two stepper motors and integrated circuit electronics. The remote controller component is added to the system to add control over the system remotely.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In order to solve the consumption of energy problem, Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring network in photovoltaic (PV) energy system based on nRF24L01 system is developed. Therefore, the system has higher performance by connecting the physical world with the network system with lower energy consumption in data transmission. However, the failure rate of each components leads to the decrease of the reliability of the system, which directly affects the reliability of the whole transmission system. This paper intends to analyze two architectures of IoT information transmission. The reliability of the architectures will be tested by PRISM. Additionally, the experimental results are helpful to contribute to improve the reliability of IoT.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - As the folks behind IEEE Spectrum's robotics blog, Automaton, we were thrilled when Robotis sent us a review unit of its TurtleBot3. This little robot is designed to provide a platform for people looking to get their feet wet with the Robot Operating System, or ROS. ROS is popular with academic researchers and industrial developers, but its complexity can be daunting.. The TurtleBot3's predecessor, the netbook-based TurtleBot2, is still a totally decent ROS platform. But the TurtleBot3 takes advantage of a new generation of low-cost computing and sensing hardware: The platform stuffs a full ROS installation into the absolute smallest and cheapest mobile robot that can support it, while maintaining capability and convenience.. Robotis actually sent us two units, as the TurtleBot3 comes in two flavors, dubbed the Burger and the Waffle. The Waffle offers more advanced features, but it's built around Intel's Joule compute module, which now looks to be on Intel's chopping block. So here we'll be focusing on the US $549 Burger, which is built around the Raspberry Pi 3.. As noted above, ROS presents a tough learning curve. This is not the robot to buy if you just want some fun; this is the robot you buy if you are willing to put in the time and effort to learn ROS alongside advanced robotics and computer science concepts.  1964-2012 IEEE.

N2  - In this article, the authors present a new approach based on the hardware and software architecture using embedded Linux and field-programmable gate array for implementation of remote laboratories. It combines a set of software and hardware resources in the interest of offering a multidisciplinary low-cost open platform for engineering education. Thus, the proposed approach allows students to develop low-cost and easily programmable prototypes of electrical systems control, robotics, and other embedded devices that feature Internet connectivity, Input/output, networking, and operating systems. In the proposed work, the authors present a codesign solution with flexible hardware devices, providing characteristics of multipurpose use with many experimental devices, and fully configurable graphical user interface. The physical setup and communication principles of hardware architecture are based on two types of devices: the Beaglebone running embedded Linux operating system and the field-programmable logic gate array. The graphical user interface is designed as a web page based on HTML and PHP programming languages; this allows the teachers/students to control the system easily, parameterize, and observe the behavior of the controller/system remotely.

N2  - When electrical (EE) and computer engineers (COE) are trained, it is imperative that nearly all acquire some level of exposure to microcontrollers and associated software development skills to effectively function as engineers in their careers. At this university, electrical engineering and computer engineering majors take a one-semester course in microcontrollers to learn embedded system development in their junior year. In prior semesters, they take two programming courses and an electronics course. This embedded course is designed to teach data acquisition techniques, detail hardware operations in data processing, and how to drive peripheral components. While there are many choices of microcontroller development boards such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino, this embedded course and associated labs use hardware development boards based on Freescale (NXP) devices due to their simplicity and legacy. The same EE and COE students take a mandatory capstone design project course spanning two semesters in their senior year. Students, individually or in groups of two, propose a few engineering problems to the faculty at the start of the first semester. After several iterations involving discussions with the faculty, each group selects one project to build a prototype to demonstrate the solution. In the first semester, they complete the engineering design steps producing documents for the selected project to develop a final design solution. Each group eventually completes the project work with a live demonstration at the end of the second semester. This paper briefly explains the structure of the capstone project course for EE and COE seniors, and the design milestones. The author offers and discusses results from a survey conducted on senior students in a capstone project course taken by both EE and COE students. The survey and the follow-up discussion attempts to determine whether the embedded systems course influenced or facilitated the selection of microcontroller based projects compared to other types of projects. Another objective is to see if the teaching level on the application of microcontroller boards may be reduced since the public domain offers a vast amount of open source libraries to do almost anything related to them and associated peripheral components.

N2  - Audio output as part of laboratory experiments provides students with tangible motivation and a way in which to experience the impacts of signal processing first-hand. This paper presents an upgrade in a sophomore-level signal processing laboratory course by implementing The Mathworks, Inc. MATLAB Audio System Toolbox for real-time audio applications. The course in which this upgrade was implemented is required of all engineering majors and provides a foundation in the mathematical modeling and analysis of signals and of linear time-invariant systems. The laboratory component of the course utilizes applications of signal processing to motivate the breadth of the field which includes filters, AM modulation, and Nyquist sampling theory. The MATLAB Audio System Toolbox implemented in this study replaces both the TMS320C6713 DSK (225 MHz) development board and the more recently examined Beagleboard-xM (1 GHz) board. Comparisons are made between these three platforms. This study was carried out by assessing both student and instructor observations and laboratory completion time using the Audio System Toolbox versus the TI-DSK board over four key laboratory experiments: Digital Audio Effects, Touch-Tone Phone, Voice Scrambler-Descrambler, and Sampling and Aliasing. When comparing student satisfaction levels, we found a statistically significant improvement (p  0.10) when students used the Audio System Toolbox over the TI-DSK board and showed no negative effect on the logistics of integration or usage, as reported by the students and laboratory teaching assistants. The motivation for this work comes at a time when real-time hardware for signal processing is becoming integrated into more multi-versatile computing platforms not necessarily dedicated to the task. In addition, the speed and memory of on-board computer microprocessors with audio outputs provides the resources necessary to realize audio processing real-time in the teaching laboratory environment. While the on-board computer microprocessors are not as robust as specialized external counterparts, their use has great impacts on classroom and learning potentials.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi Foundation has developed the Pi uncased, credit-card sized computer to help the British education in introducing a new IT curriculum that focuses more on computer science and less on secretarial skills. The Raspberry Pi Foundation informs that the Pi computer will be distributed among school students to acquaint them with the use of such devices and increase their interest in computer education. The children will be able to use the Raspberry Pi like a desktop PC for gaming, spreadsheets, word-processing, and to play videos. The new computer will also connect to TVs, games consoles, and keyboards like a desktop computer. The Raspberry Pi Foundation expects that these computers will encourage their young owners to develop new computer programs. This foundation has been established by Mullins, from Cambridge University's Computer Laboratory, and five other scientists in 2009 to promote computer science in schools.

N2  - A suitable virtual fencing system could improve pasture management and decrease labour and costs. However, recent research has shown that cows need training in order to be able to understand the virtual fencing mechanism. To improve the understanding of the cows it was envisaged to develop a new approach that supports the learning process. As cows rely more on visual cues than on audio signals, we set out to look into the possibility to use visual cues at least for training purposes. A first prototype with dual warning signals, based on audio and visual cues was developed. The idea behind it was to form a cue consequence association between the audio cue and the electric stimulus by temporarily supporting the learning efforts using visual cues. Therefore, a system based on a raspberry pi platform was developed. As a network and communication with a higher number of devices is paramount, the message queuing telemetry transport protocol was used. This protocol is particularly suitable for machine-to-machine communication through the 'publish/subscribe' functionality. Based on theoretical considerations and pretests, a possible luminaire design was created and simulated with a simulation software. A first prototype was built and tested under different light conditions. The system has shown initial promise. However, as the visual cues do not work in sunlight, the next step will be to develop an automated learning system, which could be used between dusk and dawn.

N2  - The technology is advancing so unstoppable even in times of crisis. Sometimes it is difficult to take advantage of it because in no time a new and improved version of the above techniques appears to continue this progress. Within educational technologies aimed at enhancing remote laboratories is the same. From HTTP to websockets communication protocols the technology offers new alternatives to improve bidirectional communications between the client and the server. This paper shows how an integrated development initially HTTP has evolved to lead to a websockets-supported system for controlling a servomotor. The introduction of this communication technology is simplified to allow reuse existing laboratories, thus allowing reuse HTTP previous architectures, hardware and services, including a more advanced environment that uses websockets as communications support. How couldn't it be otherwise, the characteristic of the IoT hardware, in this case Arduino and Raspberry Pi, has been essential in this task. The goal: to reuse existing remote laboratories improve their communication protocol and expand the possibilities of client-server interaction retaining its character as an educational tool.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive computing system that can play an essential part of any computing curriculum. Since its release in 2012, the Raspberry Pi has been infiltrating K-12 education; it has the potential to make coding in K-12 schools as commonplace as textbooks. It has also changed the playing field for hobbyists by offering a low-priced general-purpose computing system that challenges the Arduino in terms of open source support. In this paper, we advocate using the Raspberry Pi (RPi) throughout the University computing curricula as well. Low-priced and portable, the RPi is an exposed hardware platform students can tinker with without fear of breaking. Properly used, it affords students the opportunity to experimentally discover many aspects of computing. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of the RPi that make it appropriate for a University computing curriculum. We describe our classroom experiences and laboratory best practices as well as survey the work of others involved in integrated the RPi into University curriculums.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - This paper designs an educational robot platform according to the needs of robot education for primary and middle school students. The mechanical mechanism design of the robot platform is carried out, and the environment sensing module based on multi-sensor information fusion is designed. The robot platform control is realized based on the ADRC control algorithm. The chassis control board uses the STM32 control board with the STM32F405RG microcontroller as the core. The board integrates MicroPython firmware, which enables access and control of the underlying hardware through the Python scripting language. The sensor modules such as the inertial navigation module and the vision module are connected with the Raspberry Pi development board. The raspberry PI development board conducts path planning according to multi-sensor information fusion, and sends control instructions to the chassis control board through the serial port. On this basis, the Python plug-in management system is designed to realize the graphical programming control robot.  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

N2  - This study aims to analyze the performance of symmetrical encryption algorithms between the AES and DES algorithms, and the use of mini PC devices such as Raspberry Pi. It aims to find algorithms that excel in performance. The performance, which is a measure is the time and memory used to encrypt and decrypt with the same key-the method used in research with an experimental approach. Where experimental done on Raspberry PI with PHP programming language, the results of this study indicate that the AES algorithm requires a shorter time in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm uses a larger memory capacity in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm is recommended to use because in terms of security AES has a more significant number of keys that is 128 bits while the DES algorithm has a key length of 64 bits or half of the number of keys in the AES Algorithm. The results of the comparison of the two algorithms can be used as a reference where two encryption algorithms are compatible with the applications and devices developed.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Tourism is a potential sector for national income. But in Indonesia, people still have less concern about the importance of tourism. This situation may be caused by the static and uninteresting method to promote Indonesian tourism. A suitable solution is implementing digital signage for e-tourism to increase people attraction to Indonesian tourism. Earlier research has been done to implement digital signage system using Xibo for Digital Signage with client-server system and board Raspberry Pi 1 Model B as the client terminal. But, the implementation is still lack of performance and needs further development. In this research, we designed a digital signage system particularly for supporting e-tourism in Indonesia and implemented its client terminal on Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. Moreover, we integrated the digital signage system with SMS feature to provide reliable real-time delivery of information. The result shows that the digital signage system for supporting e-tourism has been successfully designed and implemented. The result also shows the quality improvement of digital signage system compared to the previous system.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - The Use of Raspberry pi microcomputer nowadays is increasing rapidly in various applications and projects that require an acceptable software capability and an affordable one. One of the Raspberry pi applications is to use it as a video server. Real-time video servers are used in monitoring, as well as one-sided educational conferences. In this paper, an embedded LAN live real-time video/audio stream server is designed using the Raspberry pi programming and control capabilities. The video is captured through the Raspberry pi camera module port and is compressed and sent using a special standard that applies HTTP so that it can be received from the network. The audio is also captured using a microphone and sent with the RTP protocol. This system finds somehow solutions for high cost and complex video server systems as well as the mass storage used for such systems. This system uses a video stream of 800  400 at 24 frames per second. This paper recommends expanding the project to a WAN network.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - One of the criteria of a city categorized as Smart city is the ability to manage infrastructure, property and human resources intelligently. A reliable, sustainable and customable electric energy source is an absolute requirement for a smart city. However, the management of electrical energy must be economically so that it does not burden the local government budget. From a number of infrastructures that consume a lot of electrical energy under the authority of the responsibility of the local government, namely Public Street Lighting (PSL). Lighting from PLS that emits too much light when unnecessary is useless. At present, conventional PLS systems are synonymous with energy waste. Monitors and controls only do locally without having the ability to monitor and control remotely so that if there is damage or theft, it is slow to handle. The solution is to build a smart PSL system and its management. This paper presents a real-world proven solution that relies on aRaspberry Pi, SCADA, and Internet of Things (IoT). This system provide an energy efficiency. Smart PSL will work intelligently in accordance with their environmental conditions. Lighting and illumination are arranged based on the presence of people and vehicles so that they can avoid over lighting and glare. SCADA and IoT technologies are used for work process monitoring systems and data viewers that are carried out continuously and in real time. The result is the smart PLS mode is 43% more efficient than conventional PLS modes.  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Data Centers (DC) used to support Cloud services often consist of tens of thousands of networked machines under a single roof. The significant capital outlay required to replicate such infrastructures constitutes a major obstacle to practical implementation and evaluation of research in this domain. Currently, most research into Cloud computing relies on either limited software simulation, or the use of a testbed environments with a handful of machines. The recent introduction of the Raspberry Pi, a low-cost, low-power single-board computer, has made the construction of a miniature Cloud DCs more affordable. In this paper, we present the Glasgow Raspberry Pi Cloud (PiCloud), a scale model of a DC composed of clusters of Raspberry Pi devices. The PiCloud emulates every layer of a Cloud stack, ranging from resource virtualisation to network behaviour, providing a full-featured Cloud Computing research and educational environment.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - Attendance management is one of the most important processes in an educational institute, since it is a way of evaluating the performance of the students, staff, and departments in it. Current attendance marking methods are monotonous and time-consuming. Manually recorded attendance can be easily manipulated. Maintaining attendance records integrity and security, and reducing the valuable amount of time and hassle spent in the overall process is a real challenge. We propose a system to tackle all these issues. Being one of the most successful applications of biometric verification, face recognition and fingerprint scanning have played an important role in the field of security, authorization, and authentication. Such forms of biometric verification can prove useful in case of students attendance collection. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that can be used to provide virtualized computing resources over the Internet to thin clients like a Raspberry Pi, which is a credit card-sized computing device with respectable performance. Combining the best of all three technologies, we propose an automated, wireless, biometric attendance management system that will run in an IaaS environment that will help to implement attendance marking process in a more efficient, simple, and time-saving fashion and also provide additional services which will be discussed ahead.

N2  - We demonstrate a real-Time, open source implementation of the online GCC-NMF stereo speech enhancement algorithm. While the system runs on a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms, we highlight its potential for real-world mobile use by presenting it on two embedded systems: The Raspberry Pi 3 and the NVIDIA Jetson TX1. The effect of various algorithm parameters on subjective enhancement quality may be explored interactively via a graphical user interface, with the results heard in real-Time. The trade-off between interference suppression and target fidelity is controlled by manipulating the parameters of the coefficient masking function. Increasing the pre-learned dictionary size improves overall speech enhancement quality at increased computational cost. We show that real-Time GCC-NMF has potential for real-world application, remaining purely unsupervised and retaining the simplicity and flexibility of offline GCC-NMF. Copyright  2017 ISCA.

N2  - A comprehensive radiometric characterization of raw-data format imagery acquired with the Raspberry Pi 3 and V2.1 camera module is presented. The Raspberry Pi is a high-performance single-board computer designed to educate and solve real-world problems. This small computer supports a camera module that uses a Sony IMX219 8 megapixel CMOS sensor. This paper shows that scientific and engineering-grade imagery can be produced with the Raspberry Pi 3 and its V2.1 camera module. Raw imagery is shown to be linear with exposure and gain (ISO), which is essential for scientific and engineering applications. Dark frame, noise, and exposure stability assessments along with flat fielding results, spectral response measurements, and absolute radiometric calibration results are described. This low-cost imaging sensor, when calibrated to produce scientific quality data, can be used in computer vision, biophotonics, remote sensing, astronomy, high dynamic range imaging, and security applications, to name a few.

N2  - Replicating software performance experiments is difficult. A common obstacle to replication is that recreating the hardware and software environments is often impractical. As researchers usually run their experiments on the hardware and software that happens to be available to them, recreating the experiments would require obtaining identical hardware, which can lead to high costs. Recreating the software environment is also difficult, as software components such as particular library versions might no longer be available. Cheap, standardized hardware components like the Raspberry Pi and portable software containers like the ones provided by Docker are a potential solution to meet the challenge of replicability. In this paper, we report on experiences from replicating performance experiments on Raspberry Pi devices with and without Docker and show that good replication results can be achieved for microbenchmarks such as JMH. Replication of macrobenchmarks like SPECjEnterprise 2010 proves to be much more difficult, as they are strongly affected by (non-standardized) peripherals. Inspired by previous microbenchmarking experiments on the Pi platform, we furthermore report on a systematic analysis of response time fluctuations, and present lessons learned on dos and don'ts for replicable performance experiments.  2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - In this paper a system for measuring temperature in an FPGA structure is proposed. In this arrangement the Spartan-3 XC3S200 programmable FPGA device was tested and the popular small educational microcomputer Raspberry Pi, was employed as a control unit for the whole system. Part of the system was implemented inside the tested structure. There was an array of ring oscillators as temperature sensors and a structure for controlling the array. Ring oscillators are often implemented in FPGA devices. They are used both as single elements or an array of sensors for measuring the chip's temperature or path delay of SUT. The sensors can be located in different areas of the chip. In the case of this tested device 36 sensors were used, but generally, their number depends on the designer. The ring oscillator's frequency depend on the temperature, and the frequency of the activated sensor was measured outside with an oscilloscope. The Raspberry Pi controlled the measurement process via an SPI and the results were collected from the oscilloscope via a UART/RS232 interface. 2D and 3D visualizations of the frequency to temperature relationship were made using Gnuplot and Scilab. The results should visualize the temperature distribution inside the device, but first, the right calibration of sensors should be performed.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - An underwater remotely controlled vehicle is termed as an underwater rover as it is remotely controlled from the top of the host ship above the water surface. Now the working principle of an underwater rover is not similar to a remotely controlled car or drone. So, a steel cable is of great necessity for a proper connection between the user at the host ship and the underwater rover as this is a remotely controlled rover. There lies a great variety of its application, it can be used for getting the live video or still pictures of the underwater life and all the underwater activities to learn about the underwater life. It makes the job for divers, rescuers and gem collectors easier as the rover gives the pictures, live video and all the other relevant details necessary for having a proper knowledge about the underwater elements. The underwater rover engine can be built using many types but here we are going to discuss about Raspberry Pi controlled engine underwater rover; i.e; an ROV underwater rover using Raspberry Pi.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Nowadays, electromagnetic compatibility constitutes a serious problem for the design and operation of electronic and electrical components, devices or systems. The reason is that this physical phenomenon can affect the correct operation of all these facilities. It can cause the errors or failures leading to fatal consequences. Raspberry Pi 2 development platform which is becoming increasingly popular includes among influenced facilities. Many of scientist equipment is based on this platform because of low cost, relatively simple development and implementation. However, Raspberry Pi represents the fascinating device regarding electromagnetic compatibility. Therefore, it contains many potential sources of electromagnetic interference. A great number of things that can be realized by Raspberry should be able to resist to the electromagnetic disturbance which is also one of work outputs. The experiments with the device under test are performed using unique rooms, namely semi-anechoic chamber and gigahertz transverse electromagnetic chamber. Test chambers offer a practically perfect solution for electromagnetic compatibility because they are insulated from exterior sources of noise. Raspberry Pi is tested in near and far-field, and the results will help in the design recommendations to eliminate the interference level regarding electromagnetic compatibility. Currently, only several research publications are dedicated to electromagnetic compatibility of the development platform. It was the reason why the authors decided to create a paper provides information about this research field. The primary purpose of the paper reported here is to analyses the level of the electromagnetic interference and susceptibility in a near and far-field.  2018 Electromagnetics Academy.

N2  - Security in home is now being directed from traditional methodologies to automation with the help of Internet. The Internet of things is the network of interconnecting devices (may be physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, etc.) embedded with electronics, sensors, etc., to exchange data. Nowadays, home systems are equipped with computing and information technology which provides them with smartness and intellect. Since doors are the gateway to our homes, therefore it is necessary to make them more secure. Currently available mechanism of providing secure access to doors includes bare-metal locks and some smart locking systems. The smart locking systems performance can be evaluated on the basis of identification accuracy, intrusiveness, and cost. In this paper, we introduce the idea to provide secure access to home. It will be achieved through smart doorbell which is a cost-effective alternative to currently its counterparts. Our system connects WiFi-enabled Android devices with firebase server using Raspberry Pi and enables user to answer the door when the doorbell is pressed. It learns to identify new user by using face recognition as a unique identity to authenticate the individual.  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

N2  - In order to weaken the barrier of implementation of speed limit enforcement in the country, ways to improve vehicle speed calculation such as image processing can be explored. It was observed that existing prototypes suffer with low effective frame rate, the average rate at which the system processes video frames, considering it unfit for real-time setup. In this study, a vehicle speed calculation system was developed on Raspberry Pi with Gaussian Mixture Model for vehicle detection and Kalman Filter for vehicle tracking on OpenCV, and was optimized with Sparse Random Projection on scikit-learn by projecting the video to a low-dimensional subspace. The prototype was tested and analyzed in performance, iun terms of effective frame rate, and in accuracy, in terms of vehicle speed, by applying paired t-test and linear regression analysis to prove if the optimization improved the performance and accuracy of vehicle speed calculation. It was found that Sparse Random Projection significantly improved the performance of the system at 7.08 fps and in effect improved accuracy with significant correlation between actual and calculated vehicle speed at an average absolute difference error of  0.76 kph. In contrary, vehicle speed calculation without optimization performed at 3.29 fps and  1.25 kph difference error.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Erica the Rhino is an interactive art exhibit created by the University of Southampton, UK. Erica was created as part of a city wide art trail in 2013 called "Go! Rhinos", curated by Marwell Wildlife, to raise awareness of Rhino conservation. Erica arrived as a white fibreglass shell which was then painted and equipped with five Raspberry Pi Single Board Computers (SBC). These computers allowed the audience to interact with Erica through a range of sensors and actuators. In particular, the audience could feed and stroke her to prompt reactions, as well as send her Tweets to change her behaviour. Pi SBCs were chosen because of their ready availability and their educational pedigree. During the deployment, 'coding clubs' were run in the shopping centre where Erica was located, and these allowed children to experiment with and program the same components used in Erica. The experience gained through numerous deployments around the country has enabled Erica to be upgraded to increase reliability and ease of maintenance, whilst the release of the Pi 2 has allowed her responsiveness to be improved.  2016 by the author.

N2  - This paper describes two state-of-the-art and portable voice-based authentication and language recognition systems. While the authentication system allows secure access to a media center at home, the language recognition system can be used as a previous step to automatically transcribe and translate the recognized text from its original language into another one. The most important advantage of the developed systems is that they can run on a low cost embedded device, such as a Raspberry Pi (RPi), and using only open-source projects, which makes it feasible to replicate or include in other systems, but also allows its implementation as part of educational projects in electronics. The developed systems have been tested on real data with very good results. Regarding the authentication system, the validation process is done in 3.3 seconds in average with an EER of 19% on test files with 20 seconds, and tested with up to 87 different speakers. On the other hand, the language recognition system is able to recognize up to six languages. For this system, important efforts were done in order to reduce the processing time and memory requirements while keeping high the recognition rate. The final system uses 64 Gaussians and 200 i-vectors, obtaining a Cavg error rate of 8.6% for the six languages.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most popular instruments in the medical field. Have been developed a smart IoT system for ECG Arrhythmia classification using Android device as the IoT Hub. In order to minimize the computing load on the Android device, some parts of the signal processing are moved to the data acquisition module by using Raspberry Pi 3 as the processor. In the Raspberry machine, a QRS detection system with Zero Cross Algorithm was implemented and its performance was measured. To measure the performance of the algorithm, a timer was placed before and after the execution of the process. The result shows that the algorithm can be run in real-time use in Raspberry Pi 3, although it is a bit slow and produced a high computational load of a single core processor in the machine.

N2  - The advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as low-cost embedded single board computers which integrate sensors, communication hardware, and processing power in one unit, has given more traction to the concept of Smart Cities. Having cheaper processing power at their disposal, the sensing units are capable of gathering increasingly larger amounts of raw data locally, which must be processed before being usable. One concern for this scheme is the amount of infrastructure and network bandwidth needed to transfer the data from the acquisition location to a server, which may be miles away, for further processing. The bandwidth available to the sensor network, distributed through the city, is expanding in a lower rate than the size and bandwidth demand of the network it serves. Therefore, transferring the unprocessed data to a central server does not seem feasible unless major compromises are made in terms of data resolution and size. This paper proposes a local big data based preprocessing scheme before the data is transferred to the storage. Using this scheme can free up the network bandwidth, exploit the otherwise wasted local processing power, and release processing load from the central server, allowing it to serve a larger network without the need for more powerful hardware. By making efficient use of network infrastructure the smart city applications are more affordable and scalable.  COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.

N2  - We created an auto-para viewer, an autofluorescence imaging device, to localize the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy using an inexpensive Raspberry Pi. A special emission filter in the auto-para viewer was designed to pass 1/100 of visible light and nearly all infrared light longer than 808 nm. With this emission filter, we simultaneously acquired an autofluorescence image of the parathyroid and a visible light image of the surrounding surgical field. The auto-para viewer displayed four times brighter autofluorescence of the parathyroid glands compared to the background tissues without operating room light. Additionally, it showed two times brighter autofluorescence than the background tissues simultaneously showing the surgical field illuminated by the visible light from the operating room light. The NOIR camera, using the auto-para viewer, could reduce the camera's exposure time so the parathyroid glands to be viewed in real-time, which is expected to prevent unintentional damage to the parathyroid gland during thyroidectomy.  2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.

N2  - The technological and scientific advancement in the field of agriculture has opened a new era for design and development of modern devices for plant phenotype studies. To take advantage of recent advances in mobile technology, we built a low-cost point-and-shoot prototype camera called RPi Macro Camera, RMC, using for photographing macro images of plant. RMC consists of a Raspberry Pi computer equipped with adjustable CMOS camera modules easily to removed and replaced, as well as a lithium battery, and a 5-inch touchscreen liquid crystal display. The package size of the RMC measured about 130 x 100 x 100 mm3 and it weighed less than 600 grams. The total cost of the components was less than USD 150. The inexpensive camera, RMC, was tested on serial sections of wheat straw in different growth stages dyed with safranin O-fast green supported over microslides. Our prototype camera was direct photography with samples in conventional environment with power supplied from battery. The camera was able to obtain good-quality images for statistical analysis on red and green intensity associated with simple programming including image segmentation and color calibration. With modest improvements and further image processing algorithm, RMC is expected to be useful for a variety of plant phenotype studies.  2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

N2  - Renewable Energy Management System (REMS) is a device that can be able to monitor power through a microgrid. The purpose of this system is to optimize power usage that produced from renewable energy with the result that reduces power demand from the grid. To reach the goal this device manage the load power needs fully supplied by renewable energy when the power produced from renewable energy is higher than load demand, besides power surplus will be stored in battery in this way energy stored in battery can be used when it needed. When the power produced from renewable energy can not satisfy the power demand, power will supply by renewable energy and grid. This device uses power meters for record any power flow through microgrid. In order to manage power flow in microgrid this system use relay module. The user can find out energy consumption (consumed by the load) and production (produced by renewable energy) in a period of time so that the user can switch on the load in right time.

N2  - This paper presents design of a real-Time WebRTC-based video conference system implemented in Odroid embedded board. This research aims to design a low-cost video conference system but with sufficient quality for supporting distant teaching and learning activity. Evaluation of the system was conducted to measure performance of central unit (Odroid board) and video conference application when it was operated on both network with more than 3 Mbps of bandwidth capacity and less than 1 Mbps of bandwidth capacity between two places of around 1 kilometer apart. The results of the evaluation on the central unit show that the video conference application can be executed well in Odroid (50% consumption of CPU usage and 183 MB of memory usage). On the other hand, the results of the evaluation on video conferencing application show that the application can run well under bandwidth of more than 3 Mbps. On network with less than 1 Mbps of bandwidth capacity, the results show that the application can run quite well but with lower performances (higher delays and lower frame rate) with one category on PLR reached the value of 1.714%, exceeding the recommendation of ITU-T with value of 1%. The results of this research show that video conferencing application with sufficient quality of service can be implemented in Odroid.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Information Technology (IT), like other computing disciplines, is a largely software-oriented discipline, however teaching aspects of computing are significantly enhanced with hardware support. For example some programs use microcontrollers and low-level languages like C or assembly language to teach basic computer architecture concepts. Others use the flexibility of programmable platforms to teach basic discrete mathematics concepts. Yet other programs in IT recognize that the computing world is moving to different platforms, such as mobile platforms and the "Internet of Things" and choose to incorporate these systems in the design of their student educational experience. Using hardware in computing instruction enhances the learning experience for many students, especially those with learning profiles indicating a preference for active or experiential learning. Both Keirsey-profile (MBTI) 'Artisans' and 'Rationals' can benefit from this approach. A significant problem with using hardware-oriented tools to enhance learning is that students (and many faculty) in IT typically don't have a deep background in hardware design and debugging. Therefore hardware platforms must be selected which allow for development of learning experiences with ready-made and easy-to-use platforms. Platforms such as mobile phones epitomize this, as the hardware platform is complete and sealed, but includes a variety of sensors and interfaces, which offer versatile and flexible options for instructional development. Some single-board computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, offer extensive development support to minimize the need for hardware expertise, similarly a few microcontroller platforms, such as the Cerebot series and the Arduino series, offer extensive pre-built sensors and other interfaces, complete with software drivers and development systems, making them available to a software-oriented audience. This paper describes the educational concepts that lead to improved learning through incorporating hardware platforms. These principles are illustrated with several example applications that validate the principles.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.

N2  - This paper proposes a methodology for learning of languages programming using open hardware tools. It has chosen as study case, the teaching of Python language due to versatility, structure and robustness that this language provides in the design and construction of hardware and software elements in devices such as Arduino or Raspberry PI. However, this methodology can be employed in the teaching of other type of programming languages such as C, Java, or Dart. It has selected as educational framework of the methodology some sections of the model known as Stage Self Direct Learning (SSDL) which provides a conceptual base that serves as reference model allowing to build a methodology in which the students will be participant of their own educational process. In order to enhance the learning process in the students, in the structure of course, it has designed an e-learning course taking as platform to ILIAS (Integriertes Lern-, Informations- und Arbeitskooperations- System). It is an open source platform with some features such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) resources, forums, surveys, taxonomy services, exercises and assessment. During the development of course, different kinds of resources were created and shared through this platform, these were subject to discussion providing a space for the exchange of ideas and experiences associated with the main topics of this course. The methodology established allowed to encourage the interest of the students in the learning and use of programming languages as likewise using them in the design of projects that require the use of open hardware resources.  2016 IEEE.

To address this issue, a fast access protocol for ZigBee-enabled IoT devices is proposed in this paper, in which, the ZigBee module embedded in a registering IoT device could automatically obtain a Personal Area Network (PAN) address and instantly access the target ZigBee wireless network through the signaling interactions among the involved protocol entities. After that, the operation and control of the accessed IoT devices are conducted based on the ZigBee communications. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of this protocol, a prototype system is developed. The experiment and analysis results also have been shown to demonstrate the performance by comparing with the existing access methods.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Outwardly impeded individuals experience issues in travel and getting to data about open transportation frameworks. A few frameworks have been created for encouraging outwardly hindered utilizing the city transport. Most frameworks give double way correspondence and require expensive and complex hardware. The objective of this work is to decrease the troubles confronted by outwardly debilitated individuals while boarding in city transports, utilizing an intuitive remote correspondence framework. The framework contained a client module and a transport module to give an immediate coordinated association to diminish the existing challenges with a new many-to-numerous correspondence. When the client triggers the switch, the client module promptly conveys the data. In the event that the transport module gets the coordinated flag, it hums and shows the notice in the display to advise the transport driver that somebody is holding up to blind people on the transport. The intelligent remote correspondence help framework is a legitimate and minimal effort gadget for helping outwardly weakened individuals to utilize the city transports.  2017.

N2  - With rapid advances in the emerging and pervasive field of the Internet of Things, electrical and electronic engineering students need a robust grasp of embedded computational device principles to make a proper, appreciable and relevant contribution. This necessity is more pertinent in developing countries that are technologically lagging behind their developed counterparts. This paper analyses the teaching modalities and models used to teach embedded device theory. A new triumvirate (or three person group) hybrid blended learning model is proposed and used to instruct mid-level students in the Electrical and Information Engineering Department of the University of Nairobi; on two embedded device types: a custom board using an AVR Atmega88A series micro-controller and the Raspberry Pi single-board computer. Student circuit design ability and programming confidence prior and subsequent to the proposed method were used to assess the efficacy of the triumvirate model. From the preliminary iteration of the learning model program, it was found that the model is a viable method of ensuring persistent knowledge transfer of embedded design concepts and can be developed further.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - As computer platforms become more advanced, the need to teach advanced computing concepts grows accordingly. This paper addresses one such need by presenting XinuPi3, a port of the lightweight instructional operating system Embedded Xinu to the Raspberry Pi 3. The Raspberry Pi 3 improves upon previous generations of inexpensive, credit card-sized computers by including a quad-core, ARM-based processor, opening the door for educators to demonstrate essential aspects of modern computing like inter-core communication and genuine concurrency. Embedded Xinu has proven to be an effective teaching tool for demonstrating low-level concepts on single-core platforms, and it is currently used to teach a range of systems courses at multiple universities. As of this writing, no other bare metal educational operating system supports multicore computing. XinuPi3 provides a suitable learning environment for beginners on genuinely concurrent hardware. This paper provides an overview of the key features of the XinuPi3 system, as well as the novel embedded system education experiences it makes possible.  2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The explosion of multimedia applications within embedded devices has ensured that Image Processing and Machine Vision has now become a mainstream subject within most Computer Science and Electronic Engineering curricula. Yet often there exists a disconnection between the rapid prototyping tools that are taught within the laboratory to demonstrate concepts and those that are used for actual deployment in a stand-alone product. This calls for an approach whereby students are exposed to multiple levels of abstraction, in order to align the skill sets of our students with the requirements and expectations of industry. This paper describes the development of a senior level undergraduate course that introduces machine vision and image processing algorithms and implementation topics within the larger context of embedded computing. The key focus is that the student appreciates the theoretical concepts but is also capable of implementing them on embedded processors for prototyping or production.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly emerging as the next generation of communication infrastructure, where myriad of multi-scale sensors and devices are seamlessly blended for ubiquitous computing and communication. The rapid growth of IoT applications has increased the demand for experienced professionals in the area. Since few, if any, dedicated IoT courses are currently offered, most Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students will have limited or no exposure to IoT development until after graduation, and inadequately prepared in IoT development to enter into the workforce. Therefore, we have implemented an IoT-based learning framework to facilitate STEM undergraduate education. The design challenges of the novel learning framework are discussed in the paper. Subsequently, we established effective learning approaches to address the challenges. Specifically, we have introduced a lab development kit composed of RaspberryTMPi/ArduinoTMboards and sets of sensors with ZigbeeTMsupporting to provide wireless communication.  2017 ACM.

N2  - Incorporating hardware such as circuits with elements like sensors and actuators into online education platforms presents significant challenges, particularly when the learner and educator are not in the same location as one another. Open-ended design questions, can increase the challenges associated with assessment further still. In the past two years, we have been experimenting with ways to integrate varying degrees of automated grading and assessment for the hardware (circuits) designed and constructed by students in EECS-focused coursework at the secondary and undergraduate level, mostly in the context of embedded systems and controls using platforms like the Arduino/Teensy and Raspberry Pi. This work-in-progress paper briefly covers some ways we have gone about designing problems for hardware that can be assessed by online graders, lists a few example problem structures from several courses run over the past several years, and where we intend to take this work in the future.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has changed the traditional way of imparting education. Use of computers and mobile devices in classrooms made the teaching and learning process more interactive. However, educational institutions across the world have not yet exploited the full benefits of developments in ICT. A new breed of computing devices, called Single Board Computers (SBC), have flooded the market. These devices are being used by technology enthusiasts across the world for developing IoT (Internet of Things) projects. In this paper, we have presented the use of a SBC named Raspberry Pi in conducting theoretical and practical classes of Undergraduate programs in IT and related fields. Our case study proves that SBCs can be used to impart educa tion in interesting as well as environment friendly manner. This case study can be used as a basis for implementing higher education in economic way in poor and middle income countries.  Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

N2  - These Educational toys are important in early child development and motivate children to learn language. Numerous digital toys are now available in the children's educational toys market to help children learn foreign languages. However, a number of such technologies are expensive and the quality of usability is not at an acceptable level. The aim of the study is to develop a cost-effective, sustainable and danger-free educational toy for pre-kindergarten children aged between 4-5 years old to teach English as a second language in developing countries. This toy has been developed with Raspberry Pi and makes use of the RFID technology. The experiment in this research was conducted with 20 pre-kindergarten children for four weeks under the supervision of 14 teachers, using five games of the developed toy testing the prekindergarten children's learning of alphabet, words, colors, shapes, and numbers. A design-based research model with an innovation design method utilized during the development stage of the toy. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to evaluate the developed toy. The results of the experiment showed that the developed toy is user-friendly, and the pre-kindergarten children were enthusiastic about playing with it and learning was enjoyable. Also, the results showed that the developed toy can be suitable for use as an educational toy for pre-kindergarten children to teach English as a second language. The educational toy developed by the researchers will be beneficial for those who wish to teach English to pre-kindergarten children such as administrators, teachers and parents in developing countries.  2019, Kassel University Press GmbH.

N2  - In modern days, there is a need for an effective, smart, and quick teaching methodologies helping students to have intelligent and thorough knowledge experience. Effective teaching depends on deliverable methods and moral learning environment. New trends in this regard have raised the term Internet of everything (IoE) which connects machine, people, and processes. This paper offers an IoE-based solution to upgrade teaching and learning processes. IoE covers the entire digital age with miniaturized operating system devices serving easy integration of large applications on these tiny devices. We present an innovative approach for creating a smart learning environment, in which teaching resources are automatically operated after entering credentials through a Web application. Learning strategy also supports recording functionality wherein teacher can record the lecture contents and students can view recorded lecture series and can also interact through the collaborative screen. All modules are being controlled through embedded computing device Raspberry Pi for hardware interfacing, Web application, intelligent media for controlling the resources, and scripting module for the collaborative screen. As different features are integrated into a centralized zone along with a modest and easily operated interface, this system results as a worthwhile and helpful for both teachers and students.

N2  - The continuous dependency on technology has encouraged the integration of BeagleBone Black and C programming language in Universiti Tenaga Nasional in order to produce graduates that are active in the digital shift. The integration is introduced in the "Programming for Engineers" subject for first semester undergraduate students. However, the suitability of the syllabus as well as the integration needs to be observed. In order to achieve that, nine skills are set at the beginning of the semester, in which they will be assessed to observe their understanding of these skills at the end of the subject. The study is done for three different Bachelor degree programs in two consecutive semesters and the results show that they obtained at least 80% of the skills acquired. This impressive percentage has proven the suitability of the integration between BeagleBone Black and C programming language for the first semester undergraduate students.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - In the last decade, there has been a rapid growth in applying Augmented Reality (AR) and Internet of Things (IoT) as emerging technologies in linking physical and virtual objects for educational purposes. Realizing the complex concepts in a way that learner be able to interact with, will not only elevate the learning passion, but also has a significant positive role on learning performance and student's engagement. According to the aforementioned points, in this paper, we propose a color sensing AR-Based interactive learning system for kids which helps them to scan and explore the colors and learn their corresponding words in Spanish language. Our aim is to explore the role of such an AR-IoT-based system on students' learning performance. To do this, an embedded system including a color sensor and a raspberry pi board was implemented and provided for the kids. By placing the sensor on the specially designed colored book, the light's color frequency is measured and RGB code is sent over the cloud using MQTT protocol. On the web application side, color data is fetched from the cloud server and learners will be provided with a real-time feedback with the corresponding animations and multimedia content that teaches colors in Spanish language. Students' learning performance was assessed using paired t-test based upon the results of their pre-test and post-test, before and after interacting with the system. The successful experimental results were achieved proving the effectiveness of the system on learning performance.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Computing education research is built on the use of suitable methods within appropriate theoretical frameworks to provide guidance and solutions for our discipline, in a way that is rigorous and repeatable. However, the scale of theory covered extends well beyond the CS discipline and includes educational theory, behavioural psychology, statistics, economics, and game theory, among others. A computing education researchers journey towards appropriate and discipline relevant theory can be challenging and, when a researcher has learned one area of theory, it can be easy to return to familiar theory, as it may not be clear what the next step could be. The periodic table is a visual arrangement of the elements to group like with like, providing insight into how families of elements will react. Could we do the same with learning theories located in the domain of computer science education, and would it be useful? The working group will identify and survey existing literature on relationships between key areas of theory in computing education, identify ways of organising these research areas to show how knowledge of one could assist another, and produce initial graphical representations of theory and their relationship groupings to assist researchers in understanding how computing theory is currently used in the discipline and what theories might become of interest.  2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - This paper describes a four-week summer short-course designed to introduce students with limited hands-on technical experience to the low-level details of embedded systems and robotic Students start the course using a Raspberry Pi 3 to learn the basics of Linux and programming, and end the course by competing in a capture-the-flag type competition with the webconfigurable GPS-guided autonomous robots they designed and tested in the course. Throughou the course, students are introduced to programming languages including Python and PHP, advanced programming concepts such as using sockets for inter-process communication, data interchange formats such as JSON, basic API development, system concepts such as I2C and UART serial interfaces, PWM motor control, and sensor fusion to improve robotic navigation and localization. This course was offered to students for the first time in the summer of 2016, and though formal feedback collection was limited, informal feedback indicated that students found the course to be challenging, engaging, and beneficial to their overall understanding of engineering. The paper walks the reader through the background of this course. It then discusses the weekly lesson plans, supplemental material provided to the students, and our general strategy for teaching the course's programming and system design concepts in such an accelerated time frame. Finally, the paper discusses the student and instructor reactions to the course, lessons learned, and suggestions for future offerings. The material developed for this course will be posted online so that other educators may use it in their teaching.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

N2  - Computing education research is built on the use of suitable methods within appropriate theoretical frameworks to provide guidance and solutions for our discipline, in a way that is rigorous and repeatable. However, the scale of theory covered extends well beyond the computing discipline and includes educational theory, behavioural psychology, statistics, economics, and game theory, among others. The use of appropriate and discipline relevant theories can be challenging, and it can be easy to return to reuse familiar theory rather than investigate a new, more appropriate, area. To assist researchers in understanding how computing theory is currently used in the discipline and what theories might become of interest, we present in this paper a quantitative analysis of how learning theories are adapted in the computing education research communities. We search computing education venues for specific theory related keywords as well as for the citation of the influential paper describing each individual theory to identify popular theories and highlight gaps in use. We propose a template categorization of theories based on three main perspectives, namely, individual, group, and artefact, with several modifiers, and use this template to visualize general and computing education learning theories. To better understand theory connections we visualize the co-occurrence of learning theories in computing education research papers. Our analysis identifies three main theory communities focused respectively on social theories, experiential theories, and theories of mind. We also identify the strongest links within these communities, highlighting several avenues for further research.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - Due to the opportunities provided by the Internet, people are taking advantage of e-learning courses and enormous research efforts have been dedicated to the development of e-learning systems. So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we present an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We carried out some experiments with a student of our laboratory for delta type of brain waves. We used MindWave Mobile (MWM) to get the data and considered four situations: sleeping, relaxing, active and moving. Then, we used mean-shift clustering algorithm to cluster the data. The evaluation results show that our tesbed can judge the human situation by using delta waves.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - TechColleges, a project founded by the Federal State of Lower Saxony, aims at inspiring students at vocational schools to become a part of the first generation of academics. These students - being trained to teach at vocational schools - get support during their university courses with mathematical introductory courses and electrotechnical projects using small robots (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino). Robots have a great potential for motivating students excellently by linking electrical engineering with computer science. Positive impressions by using robots were received for projects like robotic summer program or robot lab project. Furthermore, there is a large number of available systems, like Lego Mindstorms or Robotino, which can be used in classrooms. TechColleges uses robots in university and classrooms to motivate students to become a teacher at a vocational school. The project consists of three levels, in which students are confronted with problems in the field of robotics and teaching activities. This paper describes the individual levels of the project. Level one depicts the obtained results. Level two and three give a preview.  2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

N2  - Due to the opportunities provided by the Internet, people are taking advantage of e-learning courses and during the last few years enormous research efforts have been dedicated to the development of e-learning systems. So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we design and implement an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We analyze the performance of Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol in an indoor scenario. For evaluation we considered throughput, delay and jitter metrics. The experimental results show that the nodes in the testbed were communicating smoothly.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, we propose an efficient three-module pedagogical system for embedded systems learning, which will provide students effective ways of learning embedded systems through basic concepts, current technology for hardware and software design, and team projects. The proposed pedagogical approach is based on systematic learning through evidence-based teaching, knowledge mobilization, and research strategies. In our approach, it is recommended to use two platforms, Vision (simulator) and one microcontroller (hardware), such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is a small (900 MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU) single-board computer developed by Raspberry Pi Foundation and Arduino is the most popular microcontroller (based on the ATmega328), which is a flexible and easy-to-use device for conducting various embedded systems projects. Those platforms have been used for many embedded systems projects, including home automation, IoT (Internet of Things), robots, games, and servers.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2019

N2  - Purpose - This paper aims to present the design and implementation of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based e-learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian operating system (OS). Design/methodology/approach - The testbed is composed of five Raspberry Pi B+ computers. The experiments are carried out in the department floor considering an non line of sight (NLoS) environment. Single constant bit rate (CBR) flows were transmitted over user datagram protocol (UDP), and data were collected for five metrics: throughput, packet delivery ratio (PDR), hop count, delay and jitter using the Iperf. Findings - The implemented testbed was evaluated using experiments. The experimental results showed that the nodes in the testbed were communicating smoothly, and by using attention value, the learner concentration is increased. Research limitations/implications - The performance of the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol was analyzed in a floor environment considering the NLoS scenario. However, this testbed can be implemented to other protocols also. Originality/value - Because of the opportunities provided by the internet, people are taking advantage of e-learning courses, and enormous research efforts have been dedicated to the development of e-learning systems. To date, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems, the e-learning completion rate is low. To deal with this problem, an IoT-based e-learning system was implemented to increase the e-learning completion ratio by increasing the learner concentration.  2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Lower-division courses in an Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology (ECET) program provide the background needed for introductory programming and embedded microprocessors. A C/C++ programming course emphasizes the software development process, language constructs, algorithms, and structured procedural design and possibly object oriented design. A microprocessor based course covers software design in C for input and output interfacing for various applications. For IoT applications, there is a need in upper-division courses to cover new, powerful, and inexpensive system-on-a-chip (SoC) devices that are capable of performing the responsibilities of a computer on a single chip and can be used in a variety of courses. One such device, the BeagleBone Black (BBB), is an open-source Linux platform that contains a variety of busses (SPI, I2C, CAN), general purchase I/O pins, serial ports, PWM outputs, and analog inputs. The intent of this paper is to demonstrate the usage of the BBB in a variety of upper division courses, illustrating several applications. Some potential courses include measurements and instrumentation, wireless communications, control systems, and advanced microprocessors. Labs covered with the BBB include digital and analog I/O operations, UART interface, TCP/IP interface, touch screen display, and student chosen end-of-semester lab projects. Programming is achieved using C++ and Python. Several of these labs will be discussed in this paper, along with schematics, configurations, and results.

Many advances have occurred in these machines over past decade in terms of new faster processors, energy efficiency, HD monitors etc. but the basic input devices such as mouse and keyboard remained the same. This project aims at giving a better mode of human computer interaction by allowing computers to respond to human hand gestures directly. The device aims at using the same interface that a mouse uses for interaction with a computer and thus it can be used in any computer without much modification to its software environment.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - Schools from all over the world are moving into the direction of using more e-learning, digital gadgets and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). In the Estonian Strategy for Lifelong Learning 2020, the switch to 1:1 computing in classroom is called "Digital Turn". The strategy relies on expectations that smarter use of personal digital devices will improve not only digital literacy of pupils, but also their academic achievements in various subjects. The Estonian government plans to allocate 47 million Euros of national and EU structural funds until year 2020 for this purpose. There is also interest in improving digital skills of school-leavers on the side of the industry, as the Estonian ICT sector expects to double the turnover within the next 4-5 years. The sectoral analysis estimated the need for 8000 new employees in ICT companies. To achieve this, the industry has supported various educational programs like the Look@World Foundations Smart Lab project, Samsung Digital Turn project for schools, using Raspberry Pi-s at school supported by Transfer Wise, Microsofts Partners in Learning projects and so on. Challenges for the digital turn are related to peoples involvement (teachers, school leaders, students, parents, officers); resources (gadgets, time, salary, maintenance); promises (this is beneficial for improving the students skills and competences and also is the only way); lack of analysis (act more, measure less). In this article we will study the Samsungs Digital Turn project applications for the schools 2014 and 2015 in order to understand what are the goals for the schools when they think of digital turn; we also have asked school ICT administrators, educational technologists and school leaders to list seven issues that come into their mind that should be death with in the process, and surveyed teachers of one school over a 4-year period, tracking the changes in using technology as well as learning and teaching. We will analyze the data to understand the trends and difficulties schools will face during this journey. This information is needed to train all other 450 schools that have not started their digital turn change yet, but are forced to act soon. The trends in digital turn projects will tell us the maturing process and goals that the schools have as opportunities and strengths while the list of difficulties shows the projects weaknesses and threats. Looking at one school over 4 years will help us to understand the change, especially the areas that have changed in teachers practices. In the conclusion we propose a list of actions that can be used to meet the challenges that can ruin the digital turn for most schools. We also propose an area of measures where the digital turn is the most visible.  Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

N2  - Practical experience is an important aspect of the training of every engineer. One way to develop such experience is by hands-on laboratory experimentation which involves cutting-edge technology. In this paper, we present a signal processing lab experiment developed for undergraduate students. Throughout the experiment, students first learn the basics of adaptive filtering and implement an adaptive echo cancellation algorithm using MATLAB. Then, students use a software framework for implementing the same echo cancellation algorithm on a BeagleBoard development platform using both ARM and fixed-point DSP cores of an embedded system-on-chip from Texas Instruments. In a relatively short amount of time (8 hours at the lab and a few additional hours of homework), students learn an important signal processing technique, as well as use complex state-of-the-art DSP hardware to implement it as part of an application running in real-time.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - Background: Teaching bioinformatics at universities is complicated by typical computer classroom settings. As well as running software locally and online, students should gain experience of systems administration. For a future career in biology or bioinformatics, the installation of software is a useful skill. We propose that this may be taught by running the course on GNU/Linux running on inexpensive Raspberry Pi computer hardware, for which students may be granted full administrator access.Results: We release 4273, an operating system image for Raspberry Pi based on Raspbian Linux. This includes minor customisations for classroom use and includes our Open Access bioinformatics course, 4273 Bioinformatics for Biologists. This is based on the final-year undergraduate module BL4273, run on Raspberry Pi computers at the University of St Andrews, Semester 1, academic year 2012-2013.Conclusions: 4273 is a means to teach bioinformatics, including systems administration tasks, to undergraduates at low cost.  2013 Barker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - The fields of computer science and engineering are undergoing rapid change, with significant advances in areas including the internet-of-things, cloud computing, and blockchain technologies. Consequently, the gap between traditional course material taught to students in B.S./M.S. programs at universities and the cutting edge of technology used in industry is widening at an unprecedented rate. Students may get overwhelmed and discouraged by the amount of material they need to learn, contributing to high dropout rates in STEM fields, particularly in computer science and engineering.We propose a hands-on laboratory based approach to teach the students the basics of these emerging areas. The objective is to motivate and engage students by encouraging them to tinker with physical systems, so that they can develop an intuitive understanding of the new technologies.We present an approach using the Raspberry Pi, a small and inexpensive platform that allows students to build interesting applications in the area of the internet-of-things. We provide the preferred sequencing of necessary material, and the required combination of different software modules necessary to teach the students. We discuss our experience of teaching this course to both graduate and undergraduate students.Our results should be beneficial to instructors interested in exposing their students to these emerging technologies. Our main finding is that students prefer hands-on laboratory exercises to theoretical instruction. They are able to grasp concepts better when there is a short theoretical lecture followed immediately by related hands-on laboratory exercises. We present specific laboratory exercises to teach students about the end-to-end processing involved in acquiring images, creating immutable records using a cryptographic hash function, and transmitting and storing them on the cloud. These lab exercises provide students with an understanding of camera-based security applications, basic blockchain technology, and cloud computing.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - The ever increasing energy requirements of supercomputers and server farms is driving the scientific and industrial communities to take in deeper consideration the energy efficiency of computing equipments. This contribution addresses the issue proposing a cluster of ARM processors for highperformance computing. The cluster is composed of five BeagleBoard-xM, with one board managing the cluster, and the other boards executing the actual processing. The software platform is based on the Angstrom GNU/Linux distribution and is equipped with a distributed file system to ease sharing data and code among the nodes of the cluster, and with tools for managing tasks and monitoring the status of each node. The computational capabilities of the cluster have been assessed through High-Performance Linpack and a cluster-wide speaker diarization algorithm, while power consumption has been measured using a clamp meter. Experimental results obtained in the speaker diarization task showed that the energy efficiency of the BeagleBoard-xM cluster is comparable to the one of a laptop computer equipped with a Intel Core2 Duo T8300 running at 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, removing the bottleneck due to the Ethernet interface, the BeagleBoard-xM cluster is able to achieve a superior energy efficiency.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - Novelty detection consists in recognising events that deviate from normality. This paper presents the implementation of a real-time statistical novelty detector on the BeagleBoard-xM. The application processes an incoming audio signal, extracts Power Normalized Cepstral Coefficients and determines whether a novelty sound is present or not based on a statistical model of normality. The novelty detector has been implemented as a standalone graphical application capable of running in real-time on the BeagleBoard-xM platform. Experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the solution in terms of both detection performance and of real-time capabilities. The results demonstrate that the system is able to operate in real-time on the BeagleBoard-xM with a real-time factor equal to 8.10%, and an F-Measure equal to 77.41%.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - In today's environment, where every computer, including cell phones, are multicore, it is essential that students develop parallel programming skills. It remains a challenge to develop effective techniques for teaching parallel programing skills. Another challenge is finding time within already packed lectures to cover additional material. To that end, we investigate the effectiveness of using Project Based Learning (PBL) to teach parallel programming skills early in the curriculum by developing and incorporating a PBL module into CSc 3210 (Computer Organization and Programming). This is a core course taken by all computer science majors and is a prerequisite to many of our senior-level classes. In our case study, 124 students are organized into 26 diverse groups, with four or five students per group, and assigned five project assignments, each of two-weeks duration. Given a Raspberry PI, students will explore its multicore architecture and create programs for shared memory parallelism using OpenMP and C language. Our results show that incorporating this PBL module has a significant and direct effect on the student's growth in parallel programming skills. As a side benefit, we also show that there is a direct improvement on a student's personal growth in terms soft skills, which is essential in the professional development and success in the workplace. By having students experience PBL in an early class, close to the midpoint of the academic program, it can serve as a mini-capstone project. Furthermore, students can collaboratively learn by themselves (through teamwork) and apply the fundamentals of parallel programming skills without the need for separate lectures, labs, or workshops.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - In previous works, a widespread embedded platform, the BeagleBoard xM, was shown to provide sufficient through-put and acceptable latency for live music control and audio signals transmission on standard LAN and WLAN protocols. Although the preliminary work opened the way for further investigations, the software stack did not prove efficient enough to deliver stable audio performance below the perceptual latency threshold for good ensemble playing. This work reports on a custom Debian Linux image, called WeMUST-OS for the BeagleBoard xM, configured for the task at hand by careful low-level ALSA driver configuration with the DM3730 SoC and the TPS65950 audio codec to improve local audio input/output latency. Furthermore Jacktrip, an application for music audio transmission, has been modified with added support to resampling enabling seamless connection with other devices running audio at different sample rate and period size. Leveraging these two achievements, latency is shown to keep under perceptual threshold for ensemble music performance including transmission of the monitoring signal.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - As more and more ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) technologies pervade our daily lives, it is becoming increasingly important to train interaction design students to create these technologies. However, teaching students to design ubicomp technologies can be challenging, because creating a prototype, which people can use and students can learn from, usually requires a long setup and development phase. While there are some prototyping kits available, such as Arduino or the Raspberry Pi, they often require relatively steep learning curves before anything sophisticated can be prototyped. For this reason, we created UbiKit, a quick-to-setup, reusable, and affordable toolkit for the rapid design of ubicomp technologies that enable people to co-explore different scenarios and focus on the users. We piloted UbiKit in a Master-level course on ubicomp related topics and reflect on its potential to help streamline the prototyping and overall learning process for students being trained in our research area.  2017 Guldenpfennig et al.

N2  - The wheeled inverted pendulum robot has broad prospects of applications in real life. It can use two coaxial wheels to achieve the body self-balancing, forward moving and turning. But the general wheeled inverted pendulum robot seldom has vision function to perceive enviromental change. In order to realize the robust visual control, a wheeled inverted-pendulum vision robot with attitude sensors, photoelectric encoders, ultrasonic sensors and so on is designed based on Beaglebone Black board. The moving object is separated in the space domain by obtaining the image sequence which is sent by a robot-mounted camera, and the modeling, identification and tracking of target sequence are implemented in the time domain. The balance PD, speed PI and steering PD controllers are designed to realize the dynamic balance, forward and steering function of the robot. To satisfy the functional requirements of the visual tracking system, an improved tracking-learning-detection algorithm based on kernelized correlation filtering is used, and a tracking anomaly based on spatial context is detected to determine the tracking state and reduce the error rate. Experimental results show that the robot reaches the requirement of design and achieves better visual control effectiveness.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents a student project focused on designing a low-cost robot that can be used to teach dynamic systems and control. The robot is a two-wheeled balancing robot that is essentially an inverted pendulum. The robot is designed to carry a glass of water while performing various maneuvers such as line following. Students learn the importance of using feedback to stabilize the unstable inverted-pendulum system. The body of the robot was 3D printed. A low-level, real-time feedback control algorithm is implemented on an Arduino. The high-level control can be handled by a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi and Arduino can communicate over USB serial or i2c. The Raspberry Pi can be used to provide a wifi connection for the robot. Students also learn various aspects of Linux and Raspberry Pi in order to do the high-level control. The final cost for the robot is less than $250 and it makes a useful experimental system for dynamic systems and control courses. It could also be used to generate interest in dynamic systems and controls among prospective students.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

N2  - We present our approach to teaching functional programming to First Year Computer Science students at Middlesex University through projects in robotics. A holistic approach is taken to the curriculum, emphasising the connections between different subject areas. A key part of the students' learning is through practical projects that draw upon and integrate the taught material. To support these, we developed the Middlesex Robotic plaTfOrm (MIRTO), an open-source platform built using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, HUB-ee wheels and running Racket (a LISP dialect). In this paper we present the motivations for our choices and explain how a number of concepts of functional programming may be employed when programming robotic applications. We present some students' work with robotics projects: we consider the use of robotics projects to have been a success, both for their value in reinforcing students' understanding of programming concepts and for their value in motivating the students.

N2  - Teaching practicum is a learning phase that aims to complete the process of learning in higher education. In some educational institutions, teaching laboratories are not well facilitated, lack of tools, lack of maintenance staff, space and time which induce some problems in the implementation of the learning process. In this paper, a remote laboratory module for a grating experiment was introduced to solve some problem in maintaining the conventional laboratories. The remote laboratory module consists of a set of Practicum workbench, a grating (80 lines per mm), a laser source (645-655 nm, 3,0 mW), a camera and a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi was configured as a web server, workbench controller, and image pattern acquisition system. A user could choose the distance between screen and grating through practicum website page that developed using a bootstrap module. The grating pattern (dark and light) was captured using a camera and displayed as intensity versus distance (mm) graphic in practicum website page instantly. The proposed practicum module was evaluated to performed diffraction grating experiment to compute the laser wavelength by varying the screen and grating distance. The measurement results from the remote laboratory module are then validated with the data from conventional practicum which provides 0.5% error. Finally, the proposed remote laboratory module could be expanded for another practicum module in various field.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - System Dynamics and Controls class at Trine University had been handicapped by lack of equipment for experimental realization of concepts learned in class. A single existing Quanser setup ($5000 per unit) had been used for demonstration purpose but the students lacked the immersive experience a typical lab would provide. A similar, but more cost-effective equipment ($400 per unit), has been designed and seven units have been built and have been deployed in a laboratory setting. Three-four students share each unit. The hardware includes Raspberry Pi 3 (a credit card-sized computer), a 14-bit position encoder, a DC motor driver, and a 12V DC motor. The equipment bill of materials and some challenges during assembly are included in the paper. Labs have been developed based on the designed equipment and labs were run during Fall 2017 semester, with seven groups at 3-4 students per group. Topics covered in the lab include digital filtering, time domain and frequency domain characterization of first order and second order systems, feedback control of first and second order systems, steady state errors, control system design using root-locus and performance of PID controllers. A final project, which used the equipment, was undertaken by the students during the semester. A survey was conducted at the end of the semester to obtain students' feedback about how the equipment affected their learning of concepts in the course. The survey results showed that the equipment had positive impact on student learning. Based on the student performance in the final exam, and comparing it to the student performance last year, the student average has increased but did not increase statistically-significantly, mainly due to small sample size. For Fall 2018 semester, the group size will be two and the study will determine the effect of groups size on student learning.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly emerging as the next generation of communication infrastructure, where myriad of multi-scale sensors and devices are seamlessly blended for ubiquitous computing and communication. The rapid growth of IoT applications has increased the demand for experienced professionals in the area. Since few, if any, dedicated IoT courses are currently offered, most Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students will have limited or no exposure to IoT development until after graduation and entrance into the workforce. Moreover, there is a little room for adding additional courses into existing STEM curriculum. Therefore, we propose to transform STEM core courses by integrating IoT-based learning framework into their corresponding lab projects. The design challenges of the new learning framework is summarized in the paper. Subsequently, we propose the effective learning approaches to address those challenges. Moreover, in this paper, we present a case study by incorporating IoT-based learning framework into a Software Engineering (SWE) embedded system analysis  design course. Specifically, we introduce a lab development kit composed of Raspberry Pi/Arduino boards and a set of sensors with Zigbee supporting to provide wireless communication in the class lab section. We adopt module design method to design the course labware. Well-developed modules are presented and one sample module is illustrated in the paper. The labware is evaluated through survey questions. The majority of the students provided positive feedback and enjoyed the IoT-based lab development kit.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - The rapid development of e-learning and towards Massive Online Open Course requires the diversity of learning media as content. One type of learning media is interesting and easy to understand is multimedia learning media, especially video. In providing video content, an e-learning system requires high hardware and network availability resources. It certainly requires a lot of investment cost and resources. This research proposes solutions to these problems by designing and implementing multimedia servers with a simple network infrastructure that can provide video content and other multimedia-based learning media. Multimedia servers are created using single board microcomputer called Raspberry Pi that has a function as servers, and multimedia content will be accessed using smartphone devices by users. The advantages of this infrastructure are 1) Low cost but high performance approaching conventional servers; 2) Flexible and can be accessed via mobile using a smartphone. The result after performance measurement showed that CPU usage is approximately 10% from 1.2 GHz, the memory usage approximately 518 Mb out of 998 Mb, the network latency is still below threshold delay from TIPHON standardization, the video quality is still on the mini HD although accessed by 50 users, and the temperature is still in the normal levels.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Remote Laboratories are used in educational settings as tools to give students access to experiments that are not physically available to them at their institutions. During implementation, problems such as: bandwidth, security or limitations in terms of the usability, have been identified. This paper proposes an approach that integrates, what we call, a Smart Adaptive Remote Laboratory (SARL) with Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) to improve the students' experience by automatically adapting the experiments according to the student's current level of knowledge and experience. For this purpose, the laboratory experiment is connected with the VLE to access the student profile and academic information. This information is used by the SARL to adapt the educational content and the experimental interfaces accordingly. All students access the same set of equipment, but the adaptive system shows a variation of the graphic user interface with different controls and activities. The VLE provides the assessment component, completing the learning experience. The results of the experiments are stored in the remote laboratory system and sent back to the VLE to update the student information. A Raspberry Pi microcontroller and a web camera are used as hardware of the remote interface. The prototype software platform was implemented using Python and JavaScript languages and HTML 5 interface. The paper presents the design of the remote laboratory, the software integration model, and describes the details about the implementation of the prototype using this SARL strategy.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - While solid theoretical foundations are strictly necessary for any kind of engineering and scientific education, students benefit greatly from applications and practical examples to supplement their learning. Especially in engineering education, problem-based learning and laboratories are a centerpiece of higher education curricula [1] [2] [3]. Creating laboratories involves a lot of work for the educator as well as considerable investments in hardware. One of the possible solutions for this problem is the creation of remote laboratories where students can access a lab setup over computer networks. Thus, a single setup can be used by several lab groups as well as across different classes. However, this usually means that students have no physical access to the hardware and the setup adds little when compared to a simulation. Another solution to reduce hardware cost is low-cost mass market hardware [4]. In this paper, we propose that a single laboratory setup can often be used to demonstrate more than one concept. Thus, a mass market low-cost hardware setup can be leveraged across different classes, labs, and disciplines. This solution offers both a reduction in hardware costs due to the use of inexpensive hardware as well as a reduction in development time over individual setups for concept. In addition individual students or groups can have access to their own hardware to gain hands-on experience. As an example we present an embedded system that automatically tracks a ball with a camera. The setup shown in figure 1 consists of an Arduino Uno to control the motor that turns the camera and a Raspberry Pi which handles imaging and image analysis. The example can be used as a laboratory exercise for image acquisition and processing, controls, parameter tuning, system identification, testing, and deployment on embedded platforms.

N2  - In the early chapters of this book, we examined the Bonescript environment as a user-friendly tool to rapidly employ BeagleBone features right out of the box. In this chapter we revisited Bonescript and demonstrated its power as a rapid prototyping tool to develop complex, processor-based systems employing multiple BeagleBone subsystems. We carefully chose each of the projects to illustrate how BeagleBone may be used in a variety of project areas including instrumentation intensive applications (weather station), in assistive and educational technology applications (Speak-and-Spell), in motor and industrial control applications (Dagu robot), and calculation intensive image processing applications (moustache cam).

N2  - The widespread availability and prevalence of such platforms as Arduino, LEGO Mindstorms, Raspberry Pi, and auxiliary electronic plug- and-play modules and shields enable students to enter rapidly into different aspects of robotics design and prototyping. Nevertheless, a significant part of in-class robotics related activities at the current level of technological development has naturally shifted towards coding, placing a large part of fundamental issues to the background. While at the professional level this situation can be regarded as natural, given the complexity of tasks a modern robot supposed to perform, whereas at the introductory level, this approach appears to be as unreasonably one-sided, hiding much of inter-, multidisciplinary connections and basic fundamentals. From this perspective, the work provides an example of how the modern customary instruments, usually used in robotics classes could be supported through the use of additional means to preserve and cultivate its truly multidisciplinary character and mindset.

In the other hand, use of multimedia helps in better teaching and learning process. Companies like Hitachi, Panasonic, are manufacturing smart equipments which can efficiently replace the traditional blackboard. This design includes two modules viz. ARM9 board processor for unit which will be controlled by user i.e. teacher called handheld Unit hardware and Embedded Linux operating system for its software. Another module is remote unit which consist of Raspberry-Pi ARM 11 Board. Teacher has to write on a notebook sized touch screen which is interfaced with ARM9 handheld unit board. Written signals are converted into electrical signals and given to ARM11 board by using wireless RF module (Zigbee). Then Arm11 board controls and processes these signals and displays the written contents by the projector in large view by interfacing projector to HDMI port provided with Raspberry-Pi. This complete module makes classroom teaching more efficient and easy for the sake of students and teachers.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - One of the challenges for the people who live in the rural islands of the developing countries is the lack of access to education. Although ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is increasingly regarded as an essential tool to support learning activities in rural areas, the availability of telecommunication infrastructure in such areas is still problematic, primarily because of high implementation cost and low revenue. This study aimed to develop an e-Learning model for the community in the rural islands which utilize ship to deliver to and receive data from the island using store-and-forward communication technique over a transient long-range wireless link established when the ship is at a certain distance from the island. Here we focused on the design of a synchronization method between databases of multiple learning management systems (LMS) between the ship and the island. The design has been implemented and tested using Moodle installed on low-power Raspberry Pi computers. The result showed that our design is suitable to be used in such requirements, hence making it a feasible solution to support ICT-based learning for the people in rural islands.

N2  - A nomadic laboratory or testbed, based on Raspberry Pi 3 computers and Arduino microcontrollers, has been developed in order to teach subjects related to computer architecture. The testbed can be transported to the classroom. Students can access it through the available network, which can be a wireless LAN, wired LAN o a custom network. Students can access without constraints to the platforms, therefore there are a wide range of possible experiments. This laboratory was used during 2017 for practical works in the course Introduction to Technology, and during 2018 in two courses of Computers Architecture at Universidad Nacional of Cuyo and in a course of Wireless Networks at Universidad de Mendoza. Some of the experiments that are been carried out by students are: to explore and analyse the architecture of computers through Linux commands, write and run programs on different programing languages, input and output operations through memory mapped addressing and isolated addressing, write interrupt service routines in order to service interrupts, multithreading programing, explore memory maps, CPU features, etc. This paper describes the testbed architecture, experiments performed by students in the mentioned subjects, present the students feedback, and describes the possible methods in order to integrate it to a remote laboratory.  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - More than 64% of schools in Apurimac Peru are located in rural area; unlike the schools in urban area, they present problem of lack of Internet connection, hence, without access to virtual learning and they can't use Educational Resources. This paper describes the design, development and testing of the Mini Learning Management System for schools without internet connection to improve de availability of Educational Resources. The hardware used for this purpose was Raspberry Pi basic mainboard, with low cost and reduced size; on the other hand, Chamilo LMS was configured and optimized to run over the small mainboard. The proposal was evaluated by end users in Apurimac-Peru and they manifest their conformity with the tool to use educational resources and server functionality. In addition, performance tests were conducted, and the server responded reasonably to 200 requests simulating 10 different computers accessing simultaneously.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi platform provides true equal opportunity-of-use in computing globally. From it, new affordable research and industrial opportunities have emerged. To fully realise its driving potential, particularly in developing countries, a persistent knowledge teaching process for the Raspberry Pi is necessary. This paper presents a quasi-flipped learning model (QFLM) intended to spark critical and creative thinking and foster an entrepreneurial spirit early in a student's tertiary education life-cycle. The model was applied as part of a computer science component for third year students in the Electrical  Information Engineering (E.I.E) Department of the University of Nairobi. Student programming confidence and completion of a time-bound project were used as model assessment metrics. It was found that the Raspberry Pi, coupled with the learning model, is a viable catalyst for local innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - One of the primary goals of computer science education is preparing students to apply what they learn in the classroom to any problem they may encounter in the future. Due to the rapidly changing landscape of technology, regardless of the comprehensiveness of their coursework, at some point students will be required to apply their knowledge to a context they have not encountered before, and understand how what they have learned applies. One of the content areas where this is particularly relevant is helping students recognize the variety of technologies and applications in which object oriented design patterns can produce significant practical benefits. To foster this aptitude, we sought to leverage the students' own creativity with a Raspberry Pi and a multitude of sensors, displays, cameras, and actuators to boost exploration of technologies and student understanding of how course concepts apply outside of constructed examples. This paper presents the experience of using student creativity with the Raspberry Pi to drive their learning in an upper level software design patterns course.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to present the new, innovative teaching approach and tinkering pedagogy towards developing the students skills in STEM domains (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) with aim to the designing the laboratory for radiation detector development. Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and connectedness, and from another the concept of independent, self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can be used both in educational, and in the research and development purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching, hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity. The presented project integrate a Virtual Learning Environment, networking knowledge and student-owned movable laboratory on the chip, where radiation was used as a topic and where electronics was embedded and embodied.  2015 RAD Conference Proceedings.

N2  - In order to further education in embedded discovery, Protomesh (prototype mesh) seeks to improve the field by providing a wireless solution for deploying Raspberry Pi workshops. Protomesh is a platform for starting up a quick ad-hoc batman-adv network. Batman-adv is an open source, kernel module native to Linux that provides a layer two mesh network routing protocol [2]. We leveraged this technology during Raspberry Pi workshops to use as a wireless infrastructure where students could freely access their Raspberry Pi across the mesh network. Network technologies such as this provide both an interactive and enriching experience. Protomesh enhances this experience by providing a solution for wireless connections and removing the burden of tethered Raspberry Pis. By allowing students to experience Raspberry Pi's wirelessly, students are enabled to explore a new horizon of embedded education.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The study of cluster computing and its applications are vital to the future of computer science. By linking a group of computers to provide more processing power than one computer can alone, this is the principle upon which modern supercomputers are built. This short paper describes a student's learning experience in cluster computing. As part of the Texas Woman's University's Quality Enhancement project, the student received funding to purchase computing components to create a low-cost cluster computer using 5 Raspberry Pis. The data collected from experiments running on the cluster computer is compared to those from a single Raspberry Pi. The results from those experiments are presented in the paper.  2017 ACM.

N2  - The objective of this 'work-in-progress' paper is to describe a Raspberry Pi based learning center management system that assists in deciding resource allocation for a peer-instruction driven engineering tutoring center. Data gathered from the usage of the engineering tutoring center allows for cost-effective staffing through recognition of the center's usage trends. The data collected may be structured per the center administrator's requirements and presented real-time on dashboards. The flexibility of this Raspberry Pi system allows for it to be developed into a full fledged learning management system with integrated analytics as required for a particular curriculum. This system is highly cost-effective as compared a commercial web-based system. This prototype has saved approximately 12 hours a month of time, for data retrieval and analysis as compared to a previously used commercial web-based system. At the moment, this Raspberry Pi data tracking system has been installed only in a single tutoring center on-campus. Deployment of this across a university campus would allow accumulated usage trends to be examined through data analysis operations such as seasonality and trend decomposition.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper describes a pilot study to evaluate its use for teacher Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in Computer Science (CS) using the Bridge21 model, a particular model of 21st century teaching and learning. A range of introductory Computer Science workshops are evaluated that include topics such as; Computational Thinking, Scratch, Raspberry Pi and Python. This paper includes a detailed look at the generalized activity model used in all Bridge21 activities. Combining the Kirkpatrick training evaluation theory with ethnographic methods the researchers analyzed qualitative and quantitative data gathered from 110 in-service teachers whom attended 9 CS CPD workshops. Using the Kirkpatrick framework as a taxonomy with which to code data relating to (a) teachers initial reactions towards the workshops and (b) intentions towards use of the Bridge21 model for supporting CS classroom delivery. Findings indicate that teachers initial reactions towards the programme were positive and that teachers intend to use the model in their classroom.

N2  - During the last years many virtual laboratories have been developed, but not all of them were successfully adopted. Designing, planning and creating a virtual laboratory can be a very difficult process, which can get even more complicated if the laboratory has to provide access to real equipment. One of the most problematic steps when developing such virtual laboratories is the selection of the right access method. At the present moment of time there are many technologies that allow users to access devices remotely. One of these possible solutions is to use the Telnet/SSH protocols for remote access. Nevertheless, the use of these protocols require at least one active network interface per device, which in some cases can present a problem. There are some other drawbacks of using Telnet/SSH for remote access as well - virtual laboratories are often created with the purpose to be used in the education process, which means that the users of these systems in most cases are students. These less experienced users might accidently delete the configuration of the interface that is dedicated for the remote access, which will result in the immediate loss of connection to the device and will require administrator intervention to fix this access issue. An alternative solution to provide remote access is to use a console server. A detailed analysis on the possibilities for remote access using console servers, present them as reliable, but also as a very expensive solutions. In this paper we will investigate the possibilities to replace the expensive console servers with much cheaper devices. One such device is the Raspberry Pi - a low cost device that was developed to enhance the education process of children and students in the field of the computer sciences and their related subjects. In this paper we will investigate and compare the characteristics of the Raspberry Pi to the most widely used console servers and we will present a way to use the Raspberry Pi as a console server for remote access to telecommunication routers and switches.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - This paper shows the building of an embedded Asterisk platform as a key technique for providing Information Technology classes with an extra laboratorial environment for learning Voice over Internet Protocol. Besides building the platform, the students are asked to mount a functional telephony system with it that meets the criteria of low cost, low building complexity and high adaptability to convergent networks. The Raspberry PI version B was the board used to provide portability for the students to work outside the laboratory environment. Asterisk was presented as a useful tool on which the students could create a flexible system that could be easily deployed on convergent networks. This work was developed in the Telephony subject for the Electrical Engineering and the Telecommunications Systems undergraduate courses from the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Paraiba - IFPB, and presented good results in the students' learning achievements.

N2  - This paper describes the ideas of using Raspberry Pi computers in high schools and higher education. Raspberry Pi is a powerful computer in a size of a credit card. It was created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation charity, whose primary goal was the re-introduction of computer skills learning among students. The Raspbian operating system is based on Linux and offers an excellent working environment for students, as it includes software solutions designed to expand students' knowledge of computer science in an interesting way. Besides computer science knowledge, it is also suitable for acquiring basic knowledge in electronics. It is also very important to have the possibility of interconnecting such acquired knowledge. Our students have adopted the knowledge how to install and use the Raspbian operating system, how to network and connect to the Internet, how to write programs using the Python programming language, and how to develop hardware-based projects. From our own experience in Raspberry Pi we can conclude that this is an ideal platform for students to acquire new knowledge and competences in the field of computer science and electronics.  42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2019 - Proceedings.

N2  - This article presents an alternative architechture implementation with the purpose of provide real experiments of remote access and expand teaching practices focused on experimentation toward physics education. The research uses a low cost open hardware and an available multiplatform with open source applications. With this initiative, lab resources can be accessed from schools, as many of them have not appropriate science lab for practical activities. This reserch have been applied in two public schools from Ararangua/SC that also face difficulties when using the computer lab. As a solution, the students use their own mobile devices to do science and physics experiments accessing, controlling and observing real experiments installed in the Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab). Making new experiments is a collaborative work with the teachers of these schools and with the lab staff to adapt their idea to a low cost system with the Raspberry Pi. The study presented here intends to facilitate the experiments adaptation and motivate other research labs to make their experiments available.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi is a single board computer (SBC) priced at 35 USD  less than the cost of many textbooks. The current model (3B) includes a quad-core ARM 64-bit CPU, 1 GB of RAM, a 2-core GPU, and numerous communication ports, including USB, HDMI, Ethernet, WiFi and Bluetooth. This combination of low cost and high functionality creates many new pedagogical possibilities for CS educators, ranging from using the Raspberry Pi to teach assembly language to using it as a multiprocessor. Relatedly, mathematics educators have produced an extensive literature on the use of pedagogical tools known as "manipulatives" that have been shown to be effective at starting students through a "concrete, representational, abstract" progression of understanding of an abstract topic (e.g., [1-5, 7]). In this approach, students interact with a manipulative that provides a "concrete" representation of a mathematical abstraction; subsequent pedagogy using representations of the abstraction (usually pictures) help the student start building a mental model of the abstraction; further pedagogy using a symbolic representation helps the student extend their mental model and progress to a more nuanced understanding of the abstraction. The basic idea dates back to Papert, who called manipulatives "objects-to-think-with" [6]. Subsequent research has shown this approach to be effective at improving student mastery of a wide variety of mathematical abstractions, ranging from algebra [2], to fractions and ratios [4], to computation and problem-solving [1,3]. Other researchers have noted that manipulatives can make learning enjoyable and fun [5]. We believe this same "concrete, representational, abstract" progression can be used to help students master many CS topics that are often taught as abstractions. More precisely, the Raspberry Pi can be used as a manipulative to provide students with a concrete representation of specific CS topics ranging from CPUs to primary vs. secondary storage to distributed multiprocessors; topics that would  in the absence of a concrete representation  remain fuzzy abstractions to students. By providing a "concrete" foundation on which to build, a SBC like the Raspberry Pi (R-Pi) can provide the first step in helping students build mental models of such abstractions, and thus enhance student learning. Like [5], our experience also suggests that many students find the R-Pi to be a fun and enjoyable way to learn about these abstractions.  2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - The recent development of the Raspberry Pi mini computer has provided new opportunities to enhance tools for education. The low cost means that it could be a viable option to develop solutions for education sectors in developing countries. This study describes the design, development and manufacture of a prototype solution for educational use within schools in Uganda whilst considering the social implications of implementing such solutions. This study aims to show the potential for providing an educational tool capable of teaching science, engineering and computing in the developing world. During the design and manufacture of the prototype, software and hardware were developed as well as testing performed to define the performance and limitation of the technology. This study showed that it is possible to develop a viable modular based computer systems for educational and teaching purposes. In addition to science, engineering and computing; this study considers the socioeconomic implications of introducing the EPi within developing countries. From a sociological perspective, it is shown that the success of EPi is dependant on understanding the social context, therefore a next phase implementation strategy is proposed.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - By design, the computer science curriculum for undergraduate students in the United States does not include enough hands-on courses such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. It is difficult for students, especially the Distance Learners (DL) to appreciate the power of computer science as a problem-solving field without real-world experiments. Furthermore, students in computer science may drop-out or turn away from the field because it does not offer an opportunity for them to communicate with each other during online/traditional labs. In this paper, an active learning project-based approach in online/traditional computer science courses is introduced to make the courses' material more attractive to students from minorities. Students obtain a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world problems. Students will enjoy the challenges they face when developing solutions. This paper studies the impact of hands-on project-based learning using Raspberry Pi on students taking online and face-To-face computer science courses at Old Dominion University.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - With the requirement that parallel  distributed computing (PDC) topics be covered in the core computer science curriculum, educators are exploring new ways to engage students in this area of computing. In this paper, we discuss the use of the Raspberry Pi single-board computer (SBC) to provide students with hands-on multicore learning experiences. We discuss how the authors use the Raspberry Pi to teach parallel computing, and present assessment results that indicate such devices are effective at achieving CS2013 PDC learning outcomes, as well as motivating further study of parallelism. We believe our results are of significant interest to CS educators looking to integrate parallelism in their classrooms, and support the use of other SBCs for teaching parallel computing.  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The aim of this work is to create a working GPS tracker for cars with a web administration interface. The web application design was based on the similar solutions that already exist and needs of potential users. The GPS tracker is based on Raspberry Pi 3 board, which is widely available and is a perfect learning tool for students wanting to learn basics about software-hardware interaction. Whole work was divided into simpler tasks, which could be solved on a regular week basis. Students were divided into two groups based on their preferences. Main task for the first group was to assemble and program the GPS tracker based on the Raspberry Pi Zero board using GPS and GSM modules. The second group needed to develop a web application which will store and manage data from the tracker. The complete solution was then tested with real data and evaluated by real users. Students were then given a questionnaire to provide feedback on this type of group project and the results were mainly positive.  2018 IEEE.

The AOLME project uses an integrated curriculum that relies on the use of basic concepts from middle-school mathematics to teach the foundations of image and video representations. The middle-school students, mostly from underrepresented groups, learn how to program their own video representations using Python libraries running on the Raspberry Pi. Overall, we have found that the students enjoy participating in the project.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - This paper describes how low cost but innovative hardware device as Raspberry Pi can be used in education as a tool for an implementation of generalizing project. The use of this device helped students apply what they have learned during their bachelor's degree. At the end of the project all 45 students completed a survey. Between 80 and 90% of them evaluated the ability to use Raspberry Pi and implementing what they have learned so far to develop a relatively finished product as a motivation to continue working in the same field. Interestingly, almost 90% are pleasantly surprised by what has been achieved. They would also like to continue to develop this project on their own or start a similar project as a diploma project. More than 95% of the students are very satisfied from their own results and also from team working. We evaluate these results as promising.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Most universities are still using microprocessor training board that equipped with Intel 8086 to introduce students about assembly language and computer architecture due to its popularity and availability. The Intel 8086 is the first x86 microprocessor, it is no longer suitable to introduce students to the modern x86 architecture. A new microprocessor that featured modern architecture design is needed to maintain the competency of university students to keep pace with the fast advancing computer technology. Intel Galileo is a single board computer board that equipped with Intel Quark X1000 SoC. We successfully developed new approach for programming the device using assembly language. Supporting lab materials, example codes, macros, and procedures are developed to incorporate the Intel Galileo board into the laboratory experiments design for microprocessor course. The proposed laboratory experiments allow undergraduate students to learn IA-32 instruction sets and protected mode programming. The results from pre-post-test and quantitative survey shows that Intel Galileo board is effective to support the learning of the IA-32 assembly language and computer architecture.

N2  - This paper presents the idea about how to combine a set of software and hardware resources available in literature to be used as support to control engineering education. The available tools allow to mix topics related to programming, communications, operating systems, and control theory. The well-known Raspberry Pi board is used as platform to exploit the different proposed concepts. SciPy, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries, which are Python-based open-source libraries for scientiffc computing and graphical representation, are used to perform Matlab-like simulations and to implement classical control loops. On the other hand, virtual processes developed in Easy Java Simulations are adapted to be controlled through the network from a controller implemented on the Raspberry Pi with Python. This option is very useful from a teaching point of view since time-based, networked-based, or event-based control approaches can be easily introduced on this proposed architecture. Furthermore, once students know how to implement control loops on the Raspberry Pi using Python, external real processes can be easily controlled by using the GPIO interface available in the this electronic board. Then, a project based on these tools and ideas is motivated and presented in this paper to control a two-tank level process.  2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Nowadays the control education usually heavily relies on the available simulation packages and virtual laboratories, both of which have their irreplaceable position in the educational process. But unfortunately the closed loop experiments are way too often limited to these virtual domains and the students lack the physical feedback about the impact of control algorithms and its parameters. The reasons might be the price of the hardware setup to demonstrate the control algorithms physically or a complicated transition from simulation to real-time platform. This paper describes an extremely inexpensive, straightforward and surprisingly powerful platform for implementation of real-time control algorithms. The platform consists of an Arduino board and a Raspberry Pi running the REX Control System. The Arduino board is used for interaction with the physical world via its inputs and outputs. The REX Control System allows the students to develop and verify the control algorithms in Simulink and then run it in real-time by a few mouse clicks. However, the REX Control System is by no means dependent on Simulink, it is fully functional even if Simulink license is not available. The platform further bridges the gap between the virtual and physical worlds as it is tightly connected to PIDlab.com and Contlab.eu portals, which makes it an ideal choice for control education purposes.

N2  - This full paper proposes an educational methodology to teaching and learning of programming using both open hardware tools and industrial components such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, three phase motors and variable speed drives. The methodology aims to improve the algorithmic thinking in the students due to the deficiencies detected in it, as well as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language, using hands-on designs and activities that require the components mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for students of technology in electronics (n = 22), observing that the students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation and engagement towards the software area was increased during the course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming language Python in order to interact with the different ports, peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design, e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects, firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly, programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering but in turn, it has a ubiquitous nature in the areas mentioned.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper firstly describes the development and evaluation of a project course which yields university students building a complete hardware and software chain for a digital image processing application. To arouse the interest and learning initiative of students, we propose them to build a setup including a Raspberry Pi and image processing programmes. This inexpensive single board computer answers todays issues in energy saving and permits to review fundamental hardware and software principles. Secondly, we propose a low-cost setup for a time-limited practical work: a Raspberry Pi is shared and controlled remotely by several student pairs: we emphasize the interest of collaborative work, and we provide knowledge and skills about micro-computers to a large number of students simultaneously.

N2  - With the development of the teaching and research of big data processing and distributed algorithms, there emerges an increasing need to leverage low-cost hardware to build the distributed computing test environment for the purpose of the algorithm validation and experiment simulation. In this paper, we propose a distributed computing testbed using the affordable Raspberry Pi board as the basic computing unit. We develop a cluster platform by building and assembling the units, and design a containerized service-computing framework by merging LXC and service computing techniques. Three kinds of services are introduced and configured to implement specific workflow orchestration on demand. For convenience, we develop a visualized user interface to manage cluster, deploy service containers, and manage workflows. We present the containerized service workflow that links the components of data source, distributed data processing and visualization, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed testbed.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Sustainable Environmental Development is one of the hot topics nowadays. Industries were advised to reduce and control pollution by using pollution control equipment. Computers are also contributing some amount in the pollution and power consumption. On the other hand, miniaturization, less power consumption, and environment-friendly devices are invented by the researchers every day. One such device is Raspberry Pi. Size of the Raspberry Pi is not bigger than a credit card with high computing capacity and low power consumption. Pi can run Linux as well as Windows 10 in its higher versions. This paper aims to suggest the Pi can be used for practicing most of the laboratory courses in the computer science engineering curriculum. Most laboratory courses are practiced in C, C++, and Java languages. Apart from above-mentioned languages, some laboratory courses make use of front end and back end tools. Above-mentioned languages can be executed in Raspberry Pi. Following points are analyzed between normal computer and Pi, execution time, power consumption, and environmental effect. In all the comparison, Pi gives much higher advantage over existing system.  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

N2  - In this paper, we explore the Raspberry pi 2 B+ (RPI) graphics in terms of electrical power and energy. We use a novel method to correlate graphics processing, CPU load and electrical power consumption and total energy. By using different benchmarks both with and without the GPU rendering and a Power Gauge, the power consumption difference between GPU rendering and software rendering can be measured. Our results are showing that the number of frames rendered per second increases dramatically when hardware rendering is used, as does electrical power. Interestingly, because the hardware rendering takes less time, we have found that the total energy consumed per rendered frame can be lower despite the electrical power during hardware rendering being higher.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - In Information Technology (IT) education, hands-on experience through the lab is crucial because students tends to learn thing better when observing how practically it's been applied in real system. In general, the lab in IT education requires a variety of equipment such as PCs, servers, switches, and etc., which are relatively expensive. Due to this reason, virtual environment has played a big role in IT education since virtually multiple systems can be created, modified, tested, and deleted easily with little or no cost. However, virtual system still requires at least one PC and its capability is limited to providing additional Operating System (OS). Recently, emergence of Raspberry Pi provides a small and affordable computer, which is utilized in many different areas. This emerging technology has not been explored well to be adopted in IT education. In this paper, we will introduce and investigate Raspberry Pi and discuss its effectiveness in IT education. We will also introduce the building process of a low cost hands-on lab environment setup using Raspberry Pi.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.

N2  - The 2013 ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines highlight the importance of teaching parallel computing to undergraduates in higher education. Universities have responded to this need, but there remains a hole in most curricula. While techniques for parallelizing code and using tools such as MPI and OpenMP seem to be well covered, concepts of shared versus distributed memory and race conditions are often taught only at an abstracted level. Using the educational operating system Embedded Xinu, students can write ARM assembly code that makes use of instructions meant specifically for multicore interaction. By having students implement exercises such as the coupon collector's problem, they can gain a much deeper understanding of potential issues with sharing memory and maintaining cache coherence. This added curriculum fits with existing computer organization courses and helps to prepare students for future work in parallel computing. This paper presents specific enhancements used with the Embedded Xinu operating system and its associated ARM Playground, as well as a pilot study using the new curriculum with undergraduates in a typical hardware systems course.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Bridge21 is a particular model of 21st Century teaching and learning and this paper describes a pilot study to evaluate its use for teacher Continuing Profecional Development (CPD) in Computer Science (CS). The CPD programme covered a range of introductory Computer Science topics including; Computational Thinking, Scratch, Raspberry Pi Input/Outputs and Python. The researchers combined training programme evaluation theory (Kirkpatrick, 1994) with ethnographic methods (Fetterman, 1987) to analyze qualitative and quantitative data gathered from 110 in-service teachers whom attended 9 CS CPD workshops. The Kirkpatrick framework was used as a taxonomy against which to code data relating to (a) teachers reactions towards the CS CPD programme and (b) intentions towards use of the Bridge21 model for supporting CS clacroom delivery. A combination of coding procedures generated four themes that addrec two research questions. Question one explored to what extent the 21st Century learning model proved effective for CS CPD programme delivery, while question two explored the extent to which teachers intended to use the learning model for delivery of CS topics in the clacroom. Findings indicate that teachers' initial reactions towards the programme were positive and that teachers intend to use the model for their CS delivery.

N2  - Excluding hands-on experience with physical plants from control education is tempting in many aspects, but at the same time it is very dangerous. This paper explains why and recommends a compromise between demanding maintenance of physical plants for students to control and relying on pure numeric simulations within the whole curriculum. The golden mean might be the use of real-time simulators with physical inputs and outputs, i.e. hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulators. Three examples of HIL simulators are presented, covering a coupled tanks model, a quarter-car model and a nuclear reactor model.  2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - It is widely recognized that motivating students in an undergraduate assembly language course is a tremendous challenge, principally because of the perception that the subject matter is both difficult and tedious. The Raspberry Pi is a small and inexpensive single-board computer that was created for educational purposes, and in this paper we describe how we successfully incorporated this device into the curriculum of an undergraduate assembly language course. We describe, in detail, the objectives for this course and the dedicated lab that uses the Raspberry Pi as an embedded device, and then evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings (obtained by exploring changes in student performance and examining the results of an engagement/enjoyment survey) strongly indicate that the introduction of the Raspberry Pi was well received by the students and contributed positively to their learning outcomes.  2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - In this paper, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) parking management solution for roadside parking spaces. This solution includes software and sensor hardware installed at each parking space. Because the smartphone is prevalent nowadays, we also design a smartphone application to enable users to easily access information regarding parking spaces near the users destination and devise the best path to it anytime, anywhere. We choose Apple iOS as the programming platform on the smartphone and Raspberry Pi 3 as the sensor hardware, which uses an infrared distance sensor to determine whether the parking space has been occupied by a vehicle or not. We also adopt Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to connect sensors of all roadside parking lots and build a BLE mesh sensor network to collect parking statuses. A routing protocol for the BLE mesh sensor network to efficiently forward parking information to the parking management server is proposed in this paper. Finally, we present the software and sensor hardware used for implementing this parking management system, the simulator to execute the proposed BLE mesh routing algorithm, and snapshots of the parking app.  MYU K.K.

N2  - Instructional laboratories are common in engineering programs. Instructional laboratories should evolve with technology and support the changes in higher education, like the increased popularity of online courses. In this study, an affordable and portable laboratory kit was designed to replace the expensive on-campus equipment for two control systems courses. The complete kit costs under $135 and weighs under 0.68 kilograms. It is comprised of off-the-shelf components (e.g., Raspberry Pi, DC motor) and 3D printed parts. The kit has two different configurations. The first (base) configuration is a DC motor system with a position and speed sensor. The second configuration adds a Furuta inverted pendulum attachment with another position sensor. These configurations replicate most of the student learning outcomes for the two control systems courses for which they were designed.  2016 by the author.

N2  - The paper presents an engineering design approach to develop an instructional module for college students to learn Microprocessors and Robotics using multiple sensors, microprocessors and software design tools. The module consists of research analysis, lesson content development and laboratory practice selection, which satisfies the ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering  Technology) requirement for engineering education. The research analysis covers the work reported by the scholars from MIT and other universities [1] [2], where the main concern is how to enhance students' capability in developing engineering products using new technologies in the industry, such as multiple sensor fusion methodology as well as working skills on cross-platform hardware (Intel, ARM, AMD and PIC, etc.) and software (Linux, Windows and Androids, etc.). After the research paper analysis, a class activity has been developed. The activity includes teaching students to build teaming robots by combining the Cortex controllers with ROBOTC programming environment under Windows and the Raspberry Pi (in ARM cores) using Python under Linux and guiding students to develop a cross-platform software and hardware design using PIC Microcontrollers with embedded C under Windows and the Raspberry Pi with Python under Linux. The teaming robots under development contains a leading robot and a tracking robot. The leading robot in the front can turn in any direction. When it "sees" an obstacle ahead using an ultrasonic sensor, it will turn left or right to avoid the obstacle. The tracking robot has a Cortex controller to drive the motors and an ultrasonic range finder to detect the distance between it and the leading robot. At the same time, the tracking robot also holds a Raspberry Pi board with a Pi Camera on it. The image signal obtained from the Pi Camera is processed by the Raspberry Pi and sent to the Cortex controller. Based on the processed image signal, the second robot can follow the first robot to turn accordingly, thus, they make a robot team. The exercise package contains a PIC microcontroller with a speaker and the Raspberry Pi with Pi Camera. If the Pi Camera finds some motion around, a signal will be sent to the PIC microcontroller and the siren sound will be emitted. The activities largely aroused students' curiosity and attention. The survey result is very encouraging. After the class, students' enthusiasm in learning Python, image processing and engineering design using multiple boards and programming languages as well as the applications has been noticeably enhanced.

N2  - Radio amateurism is a hobby, which helped in pioneering many innovations that we are using today. Hobbyists, which use radio communication to communicate, are called Hams. Radio communications has great history and Hams are part of it. Radio amateurism is a hobby which plays great part in emergency and disaster relief situations when conventional communications became unavailable. Technology built around radio communication is suitable in education to test study cases, and gain knowledge in wireless and computer communications. Purpose of this paper is to experiment with open source VOIP software (svxlink) using, cheap microcomputer hardware, one of available Linux distributions, radio amateur frequencies, radio amateur transceivers and antennas. Different technological issues brought together in this paper such as wired and wireless communication, VOIP over Internet with voice coming from radio amateur equipment and vice versa. We also tested integrated automatic position reporting system (APRS) because svxlink has capability to dynamically update data on APRS server what is capability with potential many applications such as active and passive measuring activities of VOIP users, users' mobility, and other applicable APRS functionalities as well. In this paper are published experiences from real disaster situation during floods and mudslides which hits Bosnia and Herzegovina in May 2014.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - One of the most important application areas of signal processing (SP) is, without a doubt, the software-defined radio (SDR) field [1]-[3]. Although their introduction dates back to the 1980s, SDRs are now becoming the dominant technology in radio communications, thanks to the dramatic development of SP-optimized programmable hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and digital signal processors (DSPs). Today, the computational throughput of these devices is such that sophisticated SP tasks can be efficiently handled, so that both the baseband and intermediate frequency (IF) sections of current communication systems are usually implemented, according to the SDR paradigm, by the FPGA's reconfigurable circuitry (e.g., [4]-[6]), or by the software running on DSPs.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Monitoring of photovoltaic (PV) systems can maintain efficient operations. However, extensive monitoring of large quantities of data can be a cumbersome process. The present work introduces a simple, inexpensive, yet effective data monitoring strategy for detecting faults and determining lost revenues automatically. This was achieved through the deployment of Raspberry Pi (RPI) device at a PV system's combiner box. The RPI was programmed to collect PV data through Modbus communications, and store the data locally in a MySQL database. Then, using a Gaussian Process Regression algorithm the RPI device was able to accurately estimate string level current, voltage, and power values. The device could also detect system faults using a Support Vector Novelty Detection algorithm. Finally, the RPI was programmed to output the potential lost revenue caused by the abnormal condition. The system analytics information was then displayed on a user interface. The interface could be accessed by operations personal to direct maintenance activity so that critical issues can be solved quickly.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Remote education in engineering has been proven to be difficult in some practical areas. However, these practical areas and, more specifically, labs are high valuable for students and very important to help them grasp their theoretical knowledge. In the electronics field labs are crucial to understand every concept, and these labs should not be only simulation-based labs but real ones. Following this course of action, VISIR has been demonstrated its ability to accomplish with this task, however some limitations appear when building some circuits and, of course, not every case is covered. A proof of concept of an FPAA based-lab controlled and supported by a Raspberry Pi will be developed in this conference paper analyzing its benefits and possible synergies with other projects and labs with the objective of accessing to the potential and features of the FPAA in remote engineering education.  2019 IEEE.

It introduces the hardware and software features of the BeagleBone Black. It then presents the learning outcomes, contents and lab organization. The comparison of the BBB with another commonly used single board computer Raspberry Pi is also discussed. Two developed Internet of Things (IoT) relevant capstone projects are reported. Our experiences demonstrate that BBB is an easy-to-use development board which can be employed by college-level students for developing complex embedded computing systems, especially targeting at network applications.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - The original aim when creating the Raspberry Pi was to encourage "kids"-pre-university learners-to engage with programming, and to develop an interest in and understanding of programming and computer science concepts. The method to achieve this was to give them their own, low cost computer that they could use to program on, as a replacement for a family PC that often did not allow this option. With the original release, the Raspberry Pi included two programming environments in the standard distribution software: Scratch and IDLE, a Python environment. In this paper, we describe two programming environments that we developed and recently ported and optimised for the Raspberry Pi, Greenfoot and BlueJ, both using the Java programming language. Greenfoot and BlueJ are both now included in the Raspberry Pi standard software distribution, and they differ in many respects from IDLE; they are more graphical, more interactive, more engaging, and illustrate concepts of object orientation more clearly. Thus, they have the potential to support the original aim of the Raspberry Pi by creating a deeper engagement with programming. This paper describes these two environments and how they may be used, and discusses their differences and relationships to the two previously available systems.  2016 by the author.

N2  - Many introductory computer-programming classes in engineering fields stress coding skills, but they often do not incorporate data acquisition or output until later classes. Interfacing computers with laboratory equipment is an excellent way to engage and excite students who may not otherwise see the importance of programming. Additionally, they collect and process data directly instead of receiving artificially or simulated data. Our laboratory curriculum integrates the Raspberry Pi, an inexpensive and versatile single-board computer, with a standard computer to provide dynamic and engaging biomedical-engineering-related programming activities in an introductory MATLAB course, all without complicated MATLAB commands or routines. The total cost for each station is only about 75 or less. Concurrently, more complicated engineering concepts are introduced at this early level to pique interest in biomedical engineering and improve learning in later classes when these concepts are described in more detail. Students report enjoying programming more and seeing its quintessential role in engineering experiments while being better prepared for later computer-based courses and job opportunities.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a new computing paradigm that may soon add a new dimension to the skillset expected from a well-rounded computing professional. Computer Science education is addressing these demands by adding IoT-centric courses to the curriculum and including relevant content into a broad range of existing courses. This paper presents the experience of incorporating IoT projects into an existing Systems Programming course. We examine several suitable hardware platforms, provide a sampling of student projects implemented using the Raspberry Pi with a variety of sensors, and discuss a number of lessons learned that could benefit other educators planning to incorporate the IoT material into their coursework.  2017 ACM.

N2  - In the present paper we discuss some ideas about the evolution of "Hardware  Software reconfigurable" and from the teaching point of view to correlate these ideas with the new developments connected with the new compiler from LabVIEW to Raspberry PI. This new development helps the university teachers to better introduce students to the concepts of new reconfigurable devices based on LabVIEW and using powerful and low price devices like Arduino and/or Raspberry PI 3 Model B. This methodology helps our students to develop their skills in Graphical Programming Language (LabVIEW) at the same time that also efficiently develop educational and industrial applications.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi is a small computer useful for teaching students basic computer knowledge. This paper discusses the integration of the Raspberry Pi in an introductory information systems course. Previously, the initial course in the College of Engineering and Information Sciences was a general applications course not focused on computer science or engineering. A new course was developed integrating the raspberry pi with hands on labs to improve student engagement. The initial course should be exciting and motivating to students. By creating a new course with interesting labs that integrate the Raspberry Pi, higher pass rates and student satisfaction will be achieved.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Learning about sensor technology and actuator early is important as a step towards knowing and introducing of advanced technologies based on Internet of Things (IoT). The difficulties are how to learn sensor technology and move the actuator with accessing General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) of Raspberry Pi 3 Platforms using programming language syntax which often confusing and difficult to understand. To help people learning IoT by using Raspberry Pi 3 with an interesting Android apps, we believe that this learning module can integrate about the ease and attractiveness of IoT System Editor based on Android apps. This research create a mobile programming apps based on Android which people can build IoT project easily with GUI without program and middleware based on Raspberry Pi to connect between apps and hardware with especially task to manage data communication, data flow, and device driver. Hopefully new developer can develop the IoT application easily by using Android mobile visual programming that combined with Raspberry Pi 3 platform.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Academia has always sought to ride the line between established thought and new developments. No much more so than in the terms of technology. Universities seek to teach using known and proven methods and resources but also stay relevant with new technologies to provide students the knowledge they will need to be competitive in the work place or graduate field. In this work we will present how the University of Nevada approaches this problem with its Real Time Operating system course. Namely on how using the established Micro C/OS II Real time Operating System with the new builder phenomena the Raspberry Pi we can overcome the challenge of updating a tried and true lesson plan in order to use technology relevant and interesting to the students of today.

N2  - Onboard transit systems are commonly used for commutes to and from home, work and other destinations. However, this is generally not productive time with commuters often gazing out of the window. Other systems have proposed a solution to this problem however, they are offline and would require each device on each vehicle to be updated manually. In this paper, we present an onboard educational Wi-Fi system that offers educational content which can be updated remotely as well as free internet access to particular commuters. Also, specific users can be allowed to browse the internet by connecting wirelessly while onboard. Additionally, Edu-Bus can be used as an educational tool, requiring persons to watch an educational video or read some educational content before gaining access to Edu-Bus services such as free Wi-Fi. Our system uses a Raspberry Pi which is converted into a wireless hotspot, as well as an optional USB or Wi-Fi modem to connect to the 3G/4G provider. Additionally, Edu-Bus can be powered directly from an adapter using the vehicles cigarette lighter outlet or temporarily from its internal battery. We implemented this work on-board a fleet of four (4) buses at the University of The West Indies Cave Hill Campus. We analyzed student connections to the system generated by user activities. Our approach to this problem not only makes Edu-Bus extendable but also introduces the ability to deploy similar systems on varying vehicle types and modes of transportation.  2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

N2  - A compelling robotics course begins with a compelling robot. We introduce a new low-cost aerial educational platform, the PiDrone, along with an associated college-level introductory robotics course. In a series of projects, students incrementally build, program, and test their own drones to create an autonomous aircraft capable of using a downward facing RGB camera and infrared distance sensor to visually localize and maintain position. The PiDrone runs Python and the Robotics Operating System (ROS) framework on an onboard Raspberry Pi, providing an accessible and inexpensive platform for introducing students to robotics. Students can use any web and SSH capable computer as a base station and programming platform. The projects and supplementary homeworks introduce PID control, state estimation, and high-level planning, giving students the opportunity to exercise their new skills in an exciting long-term project.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, an intruder detection system has been built with an implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) using raspberry pi, Microsoft's Azure and Twilio cloud systems. The CNN algorithm which is stored in the cloud is implemented to basically classify input data as either intruder or user. By using the raspberry pi as the middleware and raspberry pi camera for image acquisition, efficient execution of the learning and classification operations are performed using higher resources that cloud computing offers. The cloud system is also programmed to alert designated users via multimedia messaging services (MMS) when intruders or users are detected. Furthermore, our work has demonstrated that, though convolutional neural network could impose high computing demands on a processor, the input data could be obtained with low-cost modules and middleware which are of low processing power while subjecting the actual learning algorithm execution to the cloud system.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - This educational project uses a second generation Raspberry Pi that runs multiple Open Source software packages, to perform network penetration testing and to analyze the results. Implementing this project provides undergraduate students with practical hands-on experience and explains advanced concepts in computer hardware, operating systems, and network security. This project is fairly affordable, highly portable, easily deployable, alarmingly impactful, and highly rewarding. It also demonstrates the need for secure wireless networks against various attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM). This paper illustrates step-by-step instructions to assemble and integrate the project's hardware parts, to download and configure software packages, and to perform customized network operations such as packet sniffing and filtering. Kali Linux for Raspberry Pi is the chosen operating system due to its extensive and powerful collection of White Hat hacking tools such as Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer), Nmap (Network Mapper), and SSLstrip (Secure Sockets Layer strip). Additional wireless network auditing tools are used from the robust FruityWifi package. Wireshark filters, captures, and analyzes network packets, such as hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) requests. SSLstrip strips the secure connection and convert HTTPS to hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), gaining access to sensitive information such as login credentials. This simple to implement yet powerful project, demonstrates the ease of hiding and discreetly deploying a Raspberry Pi on a vulnerable wireless network to sniff network packets that is considered protected behind firewalls, while maintaining a safe distance and anonymity from the target.

N2  - (work in progress). In 2012, Ebon Upton started the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which introduced the Raspberry Pi (RPi) as a $35 basic computer. The goal was to reignite public interest in programming and increase enrollment in college computer science. Today, the third RPi iteration features a multicore processor, a small GPU for display graphics, WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity. Surprisingly, even though the RPi has become very popular with the public and college students for do-it-yourself projects and maker culture, instructors have not widely used it to teach operating systems concepts. In this paper, I share my experience using the RPi in my Operating Systems class. The paper makes the following contributions:  Pedagogical advantages of using the RPi over other traditional and cloud-based methods to teach operating systems concepts  Challenges for the instructor and students running many RPis in a classroom setting over the campus enterprise network.  Advantages of using the RPi to stimulate student creativity and motivate them to design and implement their own related computing projects.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The light field is a 4D function that represents the radiance of light traveling in every direction through every point in 3D space. In this paper, we demonstrate how effectively 4D light fields can be sampled from the real world using a custom-built 4D light field camera system constructed based on cheaply and commonly available Raspberry Pi computers. The camera system consisting of a camera array and a dedicated calibration software is flexible and scalable in structure because the system can be reconfigured easily to meet the users needs. We show the effectiveness of the camera system by interactively visualizing captured 4D light fields using our GPU-accelerated light field renderer supporting a virtual camera model that synthesizes various photographic effects including zooming and panning, refocusing, focus breathing, and depth-of-field control. We believe that the do-it-yourself 4D light field camera will be explored effectively in traditional application fields, such as computer graphics and vision, and in other areas like science education.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Similar to a fingerprint search system, face recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects or finding missing persons. Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect's face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer's uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in accurate detection of faces compared to state-of-the-art face detection and recognition methods, and verify its effectiveness for enhancing law-enforcement services in smart cities.  2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - For different purposes, a service robot that can be controlled remotely will play a significant role in the expansion of robotics automation systems. In the developing countries like Bangladesh, everyone is concerned about safety from both natural and human-made situations like Disposal of Bombs, rescuing objects from dangerous places, a useful assistant for handicapped people. In this paper, we propose to make a Robotic Car (RC) which helps to enter an environment of higher risks, grab and move to an appropriate place. For developing this generic model, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ is used as the central control unit for the robot. Six Degree of Freedom (DOF) Arm is used to compute as the main factor for grabbing the objects. Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter is the remote handheld controller for the RC. Also, a raspberry pi 0.6MP camera is integrated for live video streaming. The live streaming will provide the actual scenario of the environment to operate, control and navigate the RC. This robot also carries some important sensors like Gas sensor, Ultrasonic Sonar Sensor and 3-Axis Digital Compass to bring out the scientific task of the robot. This prototype can be both used for educational and research purpose. The performance of the robot can be measured by the transmission of the video streaming, control system success rate for RF controller, outcomes of the sensors and the accuracy of the 6 DOF Arm.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is made up of many devices, platforms, and communication protocols. Among them, Raspberry Pi has arisen as one of the most popular equipment for hobby and education purposes because of its low cost, small size, flexibility, and potential. Nevertheless, Raspberry Pi needs an operating system to work, which exposes it to software vulnerabilities despite the many advantages it provides in comparison with nonoperating system devices. This device also has hardware limitations, which impact on its security. These limitations exist because some concessions had to be done during the design in order to decrease the cost of the device. This article analyzes different hardware and software vulnerabilities that can be found in a Raspberry Pi when using a default installation of different available operating systems. Finally, we propose a list of good practices to minimize the presented issues.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - Our paper describes a challenging and enjoyable undergraduate student project that details the process of configuring a Raspberry Pi into an advanced multimedia player as a headless system controllable by infrared remote or secure shell (SSH) protocol. This paper provides a methodological, step-by-step set of specific instructions on how to replicate this project. The undergraduate student applied concepts from operating systems (OS), networks, and electronics into practical steps to exploit readily available open-source software packages and highly-customizable hardware components. Electronic components were soldered to build a modified printed circuit board (PCB) with a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen and push-buttons, and were successfully combined with an external sound card, wireless universal serial bus (USB) card, and an infrared (IR) receiver into a fully assembled, affordable, and reliable device. This developed device can be controlled using any IR-capable remote, is capable of playing high-quality audio, and circumvents advertisements on the free audio streaming web service Pandora Radio using a pre-existing free or paid account. Using this device improves the user's experience of Pandora Radio in several ways while keeping this device portable and preserving all functionality of the Raspberry Pi itself. The goal of this project is to use available tools and integrate various technological fields into a deliverable consumer product. Consumer electronics continue to place increasing emphasis on supporting open-source hardware and software, and the Raspberry Pi provides an affordable, flexible, multi-purpose platform for both beginners and experts to personalize into a wide range of useful and specialized products.

N2  - This paper presents a new approach to develop remote practices for Systems Engineering and Automatic Control laboratories based on Easy JavaScript Simulations (EJsS), Raspberry Pi and Node.js. EJsS is used to create a JavaScript and HTML5 laboratory front-end that lets teachers and students parametrize and observe the behavior of the controllers/systems under study from the web-browsers of their tablets and smartphones. The Raspberry Pi, a low-cost single-board computer, is in charge of running 1) the C program that closes the control loop over the selected plant and 2) the JavaScript laboratory web server that hosts the laboratory front-end and communicates it with the controller. Finally, the JavaScript development and runtime platform Node.js is used 1) to develop and run the Javascript laboratory web sever within the Raspberry Pi and 2) to support the communications between the laboratory front-end and server. The new strategy, tested over a Proportional/Integral/Differential (PID) controller for a vertical mono-rotor plant, provides low-cost real-time support to the controller and friendly remote access from mobile devices to the practices for the students.  2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Facial expression recognition is an active research area for which the research community has presented a number of approaches due to its diverse applicability in different real-world situations such as real-time suspicious activity recognition for smart security, monitoring, marketing, and group sentiment analysis. However, developing a robust application with high accuracy is still a challenging task mainly due to the inherent problems related to human emotions, lack of sufficient data, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel, cost-effective, and energy-efficient framework designed for suspicious activity recognition based on facial expression analysis for smart security in law-enforcement services. The Raspberry Pi camera captures the video stream and detects faces using the Viola Jones algorithm. The face region is pre-processed using Gabor filter and median filter prior to feature extraction. Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) features are then extracted and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained, which predicts the known emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise). Based on the collective emotions of the faces, we predict the sentiment behind the scene. Using this approach, we predict if a certain situation is hostile and can prevent it prior to its occurrence. The system is tested on three publically available datasets: Cohen Kande (CK+), MMI, and JAFEE. A detailed comparative analysis based on SURF, SIFT, and ORB is also presented. Experimental results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system in accurate recognition of suspicious activity compared to state-of-the-art methods and validate its superiority for enhancing security in law enforcement services.  2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - In today's fast paced world where everything is changing so quickly with technology, our education system' model still remains the same. Especially when it comes to the quality of practical learning in Computer Science and Engineering courses, even e-Learning lacks far behind. In order to bridge the gap between what students are made to study in textbooks and what actually runs inside the computer system, we have taken one of the most important area of Computer Science and Engineering i.e. CPU scheduling policies in operating systems. Till now we have just taught students about the working behavior of scheduling policies either diagrammatically or through simulation, but here we are presenting the real-time implementation of scheduling policies by creating various kernels for different types of operating systems which run first-in, first-out (FIFO) or round-robin (RR) respectively. This helps students to understand and appreciate the behavior of these scheduling policies in a real-time environment and to analyze various parameters practically. The analyzed behavior makes students understand about the advantages and drawbacks of each policy practically on a real-time system. This research work also helps students in realizing that the behavior of a particular scheduling policy is not same for all types of systems. It varies when we change the type of processors and processes in an operating system. Each policy has a different behavior on different system and not exactly same as what they study in textbooks.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents an application of the Raspberry Pi for detecting laser spot using the OpenCV library. To capture the image, a Web-Camera connected to the USB port of the Raspberry Pi is employed. Since the Raspberry Pi is small in size, the module could be mounted on the gun for laser shooting. Compared to the existing laser shooting, our method has benefit in the flexibility of laser shooting mechanism, where the shooter could move the gun freely without the restriction of the camera's cable connection. The image processing tasks and interfacing to the camera could be accomplished by the Raspberry Pi mounted on the gun. Experimental results show that the proposed system could detect the laser spots under the varying backgrounds, lighting conditions, and shooting distances effectively. The processing speed of 18 fps could be achieved for real time implementation.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - The resulting of advanced technology, the size of Personal Computer (PC) was reduced into the same size as cigarette box. Thus, the Brinell-macro-hardness tester used Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3) Model B to acted as the Data Acquisition System (DAS) or the mini-PC which used for measuring of Active-Weight-Loading (AWL) parameters. This DAS used the triplex of force-resistive sensors equipped using IC-MCP3008 and interfaced with RPi3. This IC was used to converse the analogue signal of AWL to 10 bits of the digital signal, and then, the digitalized-data were transferred through the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) of RPi3, respectively. In the acquisition procedure, the real-time of measuring-data were revealed using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) which developed using the python language version 2.7. Consequently, it was perceived that this DAS can be fabricated using simple and low-cost design. Therefore, this contrivance can be regularly used for AWL measurement which is the one part of Brinell hardness measurement. Finally, the fabrication of electronic parts and software interfacing which manipulated using RPi3 were presented in the discussion section.  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - The Houston Toad is an endangered amphibian living in the edge of extinction. To save from annihilation, localization of their mating call needs to be detected in order to protect the eggs from being hunted by predators. The current method of monitoring their vocalization lacks real-time and onboard voice recognition property. In this paper, a solar powered battery connected to a Raspberry Pi is designed with a microphone that records environmental sound at prescribed intervals triggered by a Witty Pi module. The purpose for developing such prototype is to deploy a trained neural network predictor model to identify Houston Toad onboard, and if it exists, send notification of time stamp and location via email and SMS over the GSM and GPRS modules to the researcher.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Telepresence robots in static pan-tilt form can be a viable and affordable choice for tele-education. However, cost considerations may impose limitations on usability and expected performance. The goal of this study was to explore the usability of a low-cost, static pan-tilt telepresence robot operated using an Android smartphone. Experiments were carried out with 26 participants from two age groups (14 students M = 20 years, 12 staff M = 25 years) in a laboratory. Each participant interacted with the robot to perform two tasks. The opinions of the participants preand post-experiments, and the time they took to complete the tasks, were recorded. The results show that the average latency (of 3.1  0.8 s for one robot movement) is quite acceptable. The students were faster than the staff when controlling the robot remotely but slower when working at the robot site. Correlation analysis shows that confidence in the robot and the likelihood of adoption is strongly related to data privacy features. All the methods used to control the robot remotely show positive interaction to each other. This implies that the majority of participants were focussed on the control methods and data privacy provided in the robot platform, and were willing to accept a small delay in robot movement.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) is being used more and more nowadays. While this makes our lives much easier, offering modern solutions like smart homes or cars, it also brings new security issues in this area: sensors and other similar IoT devices with scarce resources and functionality have limited ways of providing appropriate security, and every day there is an increasing number of malicious users taking advantage of this. As providing per-device protection is difficult or even impossible, a much better solution would be to do this in centralized manner, from the network router all local IoT devices are connected to. In this paper we propose a router-level IoT security method using a Raspberry Pi configured as a network router. We describe the necessary steps to conFigure the proposed security infrastructure, some possible attacks (e.g. SQL-injection, DoS, brute-force attacks) and defense strategies we developed against them.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Space weather research is an important aspect in studying and monitoring the effects of extraterrestrial forces outside the earth on human activities. Stanford University under International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI) program has developed first generation of sudden ionospheric detection named as SuperSID. To enable the usage of this system for community outreach space science education program, a portable and low cost system need to be developed. Raspberry Pi can be used as the main processor for the SID system. It can be easily operated without the need of a personal computer. However, the available sound card are limited and sampling rate is on 48 kHz. This limit the detection of the VLF frequency detection to approximately 22 kHz. Thus it become a limiting factor to view the VLF spectrum in a full range (3-30 kHz). To overcome this problem, a VLF receiver system with a better sound card (Audio Injector) was proposed to detect the signal in a full VLF spectrum with the objective for a better data analysis. The hardware aspects including an antenna, a preamplifier, a sound card (Audio Injector) and a microprocessor (Raspberry Pi) with LCD Touchscreen as its monitor display. The VLF acquisition software part consists of an acquisition software executable by Python programming language with additional modules that runs in Raspberry Pi. Finally a portable VLF receiver system with maximum sampling rate of 96 kHz has been developed to capture VLF signal between 3-30 kHz.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Sensor networks are a highly researched application area in the field of Internet of Things (IoT). A key cost and resource question in the development of IoT network sensor solutions is prototype implementation. In this study, the Raspberry Pi-a widely used single board computer-is investigated as it is one of the most commonly used prototyping devices available and is also widely used in scientific research. In this paper, we address which technologies, the usefulness and what kinds of issues arise when the prototyping of a sensor network solution is done with Raspberry Pi. The extant literature is studied by selecting papers with the systematic literature review method. Based on an extensive survey of the selected studies, we found several sensor-based implementations where Raspberry Pi has been used. In addition, this survey revealed subjects, such as e-health and education, which expanded the research topic in new ways. Further research opportunities have been identified in specifying the usefulness of various technologies with single board computers.  2017 Croatian Society MIPRO.

N2  - The miniature Raspberry Pi computer has become of interest to many researchers as a platform for building sociotechnical IoT systems for end-users; however, for the end-user to design and build such apps themselves requires new people-oriented tools and design methods. This chapter describes a people-oriented design method called TANDEM and demonstrates the use of it in detail, by way of a case study- the design of a mashup of services and local data stores-that solves the so-called movie-cinema problem. An implementation of the newly designed movie-cinema app is then built within the DigitalFriend, an end-user programmer IDE. Furthermore, a significant part of the TANDEM design method is then automated within the development tool itself. This automation removes the most skilled task required by TANDEM of the end-user: The automation of the process of data normalization. The automation applies data normalization to the initial model of components and data sources that feed into the mashup. The presentation here relies on some understanding of data normalization, so a simple example is presented. After this demonstrated example of the method and the implementation, the authors discuss the applicability of a model achievable by end-users using TANDEM coupled with the automated normalization process built into the IDE vs. using a top-down model by an experienced information analyst. In conclusion, the TANDEM method combined with the automation as demonstrated does empower an end-user to a significant degree in achieving a workable mashup of distributed services and local data stores and feeds. Such a powerful combination of methods and tools will help the Raspberry Pi to become a significant people-oriented platform, beyond just a platformfor teaching novices to code. Furthermore, the TANDEM method does have broader applicability to designing a broad class of logic programs, complementing the use of collected patterns in logic programs.  2018 by IGI Global.

N2  - Modern memory hierarchies are complex pieces of hardware, combining memory controllers, caches, and memory-management units in a desperate attempt to keep modern high-speed processors fed with data. Recent developments, including the introduction of nonvolatile memory, further complicate the situation. Operating systems are highly tuned to current memory systems; modifying them to take advantage of new developments is a difficult process. The low-level code involved is complex and hard to follow. This makes teaching students about modern memory systems a struggle, as wading through the complicated code in a full operating system like Linux can be frustrating. To this end we develop vmwOS, a simple operating system designed for low-cost Raspberry Pi development boards. Although inexpensive, these widely used boards support most of the features of modern memory systems, including 64-bit addresses, multi-level caches, multi-core, and full ARMv8 processor and MMU support. vmwOS is simple enough that students can follow the code and make modifications for memory hierarchy exploration. We describe a number of memory research topics that can be explored with this infrastructure, including a detailed examination of simulating non-volatile RAM support.  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The electrochemical sensor exploits current or voltage on the electrodes when the chemical reaction occurs between the sensitive part of the electrode and the heavy metal ion detected. The output of current or voltage changes corresponds to the amount of ion concentration of heavy metal in water. This research aims to develop signal processing system using raspberry PI as a supporting electronic scheme of electrochemical sensor to detect and analize heavy metal pollutant. The system contains of potentiostat, signal conditioning and data acquisition schemes. This research covers the activities of the design and development of Raspberry Pi based supporting electronic scheme, PCB and the electronic components, as well as the software program for the measurement of signal input from the electrochemical sensor. The performance of K500 system developed in the research is a little bit lower than that of the system published by another researcher. Despite its performance, this system costs only $45 cheaper than previous system that costs $100. For full version, i.e. including Raspberry Pi as a server, the K500 system with the dimension of 110x90x70 mm costs only $70, cheaper than the other system using laptop computer as a server that costs $60 without its server.

N2  - The demand for more efficient and environmentally benign, non-conventional sources of energy came into picture due to increasing demands for human comforts. Solar energy is now the ultimate option. In this paper, the instruments used to measure the solar radiation at Innovation Centre, MIT Manipal were connected to a Raspberry Pi to access the data remotely. Genetic Algorithms were formulated, so that the monthly mean global solar radiation in Manipal can be effectively estimated. Meteorological data such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, etc. were used as inputs to train the networks. A successful network was made between the data loggers and the Raspberry Pi. The data collected by the data loggers from the devices are transmitted to the Raspberry Pi which in turn sends the data to an internal server. The Raspberry Pi can be accessed using any SSH client such as PuTTY. The meteorological data was collected for the years 2010-2014 in order to formulate the Artificial Intelligence models. The validity of the formulated models were checked by comparing the measured data with the estimated data using tools such as RMSE, correlation coefficient, etc. The modelling of solar radiation using GA was carried out in GeneXpro tools version 5.0.  2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

N2  - A talking pen is the evolutional way of learning especially for children because it is fun and interactive. Commercial talking pen use a small infrared camera to capture the hidden dot patterns that hidden around a book's page. Specific sounds are generated according to the location of the pen on the pages. This image processing for recognition technique is complex and need calculation power because it had to calculate relative location and orientation of dots in a group. Although, the talking pen is successful product but it is not flexible to add new pattern or uses different set of patterns. In this research, the new approach for hidden dot pattern recognition is proposed. Convolutional neural networks or CNNs is selected as the recognition software. The system is built on Raspberry Pi Zero W hardware with Raspbian operating system and TensorFlow platform. MobileNet is used in the research since it small and effective for limited resources platform. MobileNet is trained by using the infrared images that captured by infrared camera module that connected to Raspberry Pi. Result shows that the accuracy of the proposed method is good enough and the response is fast enough to be implemented into the real-time commercial product and has ability to expand to any other kind of patterns without limit because the learned network can be updated easily without alter recognition software.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Small credit-card-sized single-board computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, are becoming ever more popular in areas unrelated to the education of children, for which they were originally intended. So far, these computers have mainly been used in small-scale projects focusing very often on hardware aspects. We want to take single-board computer architectures a step further by showing how to deploy part of an orchestration platform (OpenStack Swift) on a Raspberry Pi cluster to make it a useful platform for more sophisticated data collection and analysis applications located at the edge of a cloud. Our results illustrate that this is indeed possible, but that there are still shortcomings in terms of performance. Nevertheless, with the next generation of small single-board computers that have been introduced recently, we believe that this is a viable approach for certain application domains, such as private clouds or edge computing in harsh environments.

N2  - Wireless sensor network applications in the agricultural sector are gaining popularity with the advancement of the Internet of Things technology. Predominantly, wireless sensor networks are used in agriculture to sense the important agricultural field parameters, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture level, nitrite content in the soil, groundwater quality, and so on. These sensed parameters will be sent to a remote station, where it will be processed and analyzed to build a decision support system. This paper describes the implementation of a wireless visual sensor network for precision agriculture to monitor paddy crop for weeds using Raspberry Pi. Bluetooth 4.0 was used by visual sensor nodes to send the data to the base station. Base station forwarded the data to the remote station using IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n standard. The solar cell battery was used to power up the sensor nodes and the base station. At the remote station, images were preprocessed to remove soil background and different shape features were extracted. Random forest and support vector machine classifiers were used to classify the paddy crop and weed based on the shape features. The results and observations obtained from the experimental setup of the system in a small paddy field are also reported. This system could be expected to enhance the crop production by giving timely advice to the crop producers about the presence of weeds so that steps can be taken to eradicate weeds.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - Middleware is a software layer located between software (operating system) and hardware (physical). This layer is flexible, where middleware can be built with a variety of features for many functions or even spesific tasks. Typically, middleware used in distributed system for software development. In this paper, the middleware created using Python parallel programming language and will be planted on Raspberry Pi 3. To help people learning IoT for basic, we create console apps for send and receiving command line data to access sensor or actuator. This middleware serves to translate a line of commands used to run or access the various features contained in IoT module. For the time efficiency of program function execution, multiprocessing or multithreading is used in Python. The multiprocessing or multithreading used in Python is expected to create middleware with distributed process for more efficient processor, to provide heterogeneity access of sensor or actuator, more simply hardware interfacing and to enhance collaboration between application and hardware. At the last, we compare multiprocessing and multithreading for CPU bond and memory usage.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, it is aimed to implement object detection and recognition algorithms for a robotic arm platform. With these algorithms, the objects that are desired to be grasped by the gripper of the robotic arm are recognized and located. In the experimental setup that established, OWI-535 robotic arm with 4 DOF and a gripper, which is similar to the robotic arms used in the industry, is preferred. Local feature-based algorithms such as SIFT, SURF, FAST, and ORB are used on the images which are captured via the camera to detect and recognize the target object to be grasped by the gripper of the robotic arm. These algorithms are implemented in the software for object recognition and localization, which is written in C++ programming language using OpenCV library and the software runs on the Raspberry Pi embedded Linux platform. In the experimental studies, the performance of the features which are extracted with the SIFT, SURF, FAST, and ORB algorithms are compared. This study, which is first implemented with OWI-535 robotic arm, shows that the local feature-based algorithms are suitable for education and industrial applications.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - The convenience for most people is to have the ability to control or view details of surveillance made by a robotic system even when they are not at home. In this paper, we design an efficient robot that is capable of video surveillance even at night. The method consists of a web based wireless controlled night vision surveillance robot using Shell script with raspberry pi. The web page has video screen for surveillance and buttons to control robot and camera. For proper surveillance at night, a night vision camera has been implemented. The web page is the command control center for the robot, which can be run in both computer and mobile phone (IOS/Android). The signal, which is generated from web page, are sent to Raspberry pi through Wi-Fi and Raspberry pi receives these signals according to Shell Script written in Raspberry pi. Therefore, the commands are processed and the robot is directed with user directive. The Video Streaming is done using MJPG streamer program that gets MJPEG data and the movement of the robot is controlled by Shell Script which sends it through a HTTP session. The result shows that the video streamed up to 15 frames per second.  2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.
