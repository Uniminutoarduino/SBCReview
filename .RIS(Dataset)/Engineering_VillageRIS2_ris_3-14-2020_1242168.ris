N2  - This study aims to analyze the performance of symmetrical encryption algorithms between the AES and DES algorithms, and the use of mini PC devices such as Raspberry Pi. It aims to find algorithms that excel in performance. The performance, which is a measure is the time and memory used to encrypt and decrypt with the same key-the method used in research with an experimental approach. Where experimental done on Raspberry PI with PHP programming language, the results of this study indicate that the AES algorithm requires a shorter time in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm uses a larger memory capacity in encrypting messages compared to the DES algorithm. The AES algorithm is recommended to use because in terms of security AES has a more significant number of keys that is 128 bits while the DES algorithm has a key length of 64 bits or half of the number of keys in the AES Algorithm. The results of the comparison of the two algorithms can be used as a reference where two encryption algorithms are compatible with the applications and devices developed.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Tourism is a potential sector for national income. But in Indonesia, people still have less concern about the importance of tourism. This situation may be caused by the static and uninteresting method to promote Indonesian tourism. A suitable solution is implementing digital signage for e-tourism to increase people attraction to Indonesian tourism. Earlier research has been done to implement digital signage system using Xibo for Digital Signage with client-server system and board Raspberry Pi 1 Model B as the client terminal. But, the implementation is still lack of performance and needs further development. In this research, we designed a digital signage system particularly for supporting e-tourism in Indonesia and implemented its client terminal on Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. Moreover, we integrated the digital signage system with SMS feature to provide reliable real-time delivery of information. The result shows that the digital signage system for supporting e-tourism has been successfully designed and implemented. The result also shows the quality improvement of digital signage system compared to the previous system.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - The Use of Raspberry pi microcomputer nowadays is increasing rapidly in various applications and projects that require an acceptable software capability and an affordable one. One of the Raspberry pi applications is to use it as a video server. Real-time video servers are used in monitoring, as well as one-sided educational conferences. In this paper, an embedded LAN live real-time video/audio stream server is designed using the Raspberry pi programming and control capabilities. The video is captured through the Raspberry pi camera module port and is compressed and sent using a special standard that applies HTTP so that it can be received from the network. The audio is also captured using a microphone and sent with the RTP protocol. This system finds somehow solutions for high cost and complex video server systems as well as the mass storage used for such systems. This system uses a video stream of 800  400 at 24 frames per second. This paper recommends expanding the project to a WAN network.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - One of the criteria of a city categorized as Smart city is the ability to manage infrastructure, property and human resources intelligently. A reliable, sustainable and customable electric energy source is an absolute requirement for a smart city. However, the management of electrical energy must be economically so that it does not burden the local government budget. From a number of infrastructures that consume a lot of electrical energy under the authority of the responsibility of the local government, namely Public Street Lighting (PSL). Lighting from PLS that emits too much light when unnecessary is useless. At present, conventional PLS systems are synonymous with energy waste. Monitors and controls only do locally without having the ability to monitor and control remotely so that if there is damage or theft, it is slow to handle. The solution is to build a smart PSL system and its management. This paper presents a real-world proven solution that relies on aRaspberry Pi, SCADA, and Internet of Things (IoT). This system provide an energy efficiency. Smart PSL will work intelligently in accordance with their environmental conditions. Lighting and illumination are arranged based on the presence of people and vehicles so that they can avoid over lighting and glare. SCADA and IoT technologies are used for work process monitoring systems and data viewers that are carried out continuously and in real time. The result is the smart PLS mode is 43% more efficient than conventional PLS modes.  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Data Centers (DC) used to support Cloud services often consist of tens of thousands of networked machines under a single roof. The significant capital outlay required to replicate such infrastructures constitutes a major obstacle to practical implementation and evaluation of research in this domain. Currently, most research into Cloud computing relies on either limited software simulation, or the use of a testbed environments with a handful of machines. The recent introduction of the Raspberry Pi, a low-cost, low-power single-board computer, has made the construction of a miniature Cloud DCs more affordable. In this paper, we present the Glasgow Raspberry Pi Cloud (PiCloud), a scale model of a DC composed of clusters of Raspberry Pi devices. The PiCloud emulates every layer of a Cloud stack, ranging from resource virtualisation to network behaviour, providing a full-featured Cloud Computing research and educational environment.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - Attendance management is one of the most important processes in an educational institute, since it is a way of evaluating the performance of the students, staff, and departments in it. Current attendance marking methods are monotonous and time-consuming. Manually recorded attendance can be easily manipulated. Maintaining attendance records integrity and security, and reducing the valuable amount of time and hassle spent in the overall process is a real challenge. We propose a system to tackle all these issues. Being one of the most successful applications of biometric verification, face recognition and fingerprint scanning have played an important role in the field of security, authorization, and authentication. Such forms of biometric verification can prove useful in case of students attendance collection. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that can be used to provide virtualized computing resources over the Internet to thin clients like a Raspberry Pi, which is a credit card-sized computing device with respectable performance. Combining the best of all three technologies, we propose an automated, wireless, biometric attendance management system that will run in an IaaS environment that will help to implement attendance marking process in a more efficient, simple, and time-saving fashion and also provide additional services which will be discussed ahead.

N2  - We demonstrate a real-Time, open source implementation of the online GCC-NMF stereo speech enhancement algorithm. While the system runs on a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms, we highlight its potential for real-world mobile use by presenting it on two embedded systems: The Raspberry Pi 3 and the NVIDIA Jetson TX1. The effect of various algorithm parameters on subjective enhancement quality may be explored interactively via a graphical user interface, with the results heard in real-Time. The trade-off between interference suppression and target fidelity is controlled by manipulating the parameters of the coefficient masking function. Increasing the pre-learned dictionary size improves overall speech enhancement quality at increased computational cost. We show that real-Time GCC-NMF has potential for real-world application, remaining purely unsupervised and retaining the simplicity and flexibility of offline GCC-NMF. Copyright  2017 ISCA.

N2  - A comprehensive radiometric characterization of raw-data format imagery acquired with the Raspberry Pi 3 and V2.1 camera module is presented. The Raspberry Pi is a high-performance single-board computer designed to educate and solve real-world problems. This small computer supports a camera module that uses a Sony IMX219 8 megapixel CMOS sensor. This paper shows that scientific and engineering-grade imagery can be produced with the Raspberry Pi 3 and its V2.1 camera module. Raw imagery is shown to be linear with exposure and gain (ISO), which is essential for scientific and engineering applications. Dark frame, noise, and exposure stability assessments along with flat fielding results, spectral response measurements, and absolute radiometric calibration results are described. This low-cost imaging sensor, when calibrated to produce scientific quality data, can be used in computer vision, biophotonics, remote sensing, astronomy, high dynamic range imaging, and security applications, to name a few.

N2  - Replicating software performance experiments is difficult. A common obstacle to replication is that recreating the hardware and software environments is often impractical. As researchers usually run their experiments on the hardware and software that happens to be available to them, recreating the experiments would require obtaining identical hardware, which can lead to high costs. Recreating the software environment is also difficult, as software components such as particular library versions might no longer be available. Cheap, standardized hardware components like the Raspberry Pi and portable software containers like the ones provided by Docker are a potential solution to meet the challenge of replicability. In this paper, we report on experiences from replicating performance experiments on Raspberry Pi devices with and without Docker and show that good replication results can be achieved for microbenchmarks such as JMH. Replication of macrobenchmarks like SPECjEnterprise 2010 proves to be much more difficult, as they are strongly affected by (non-standardized) peripherals. Inspired by previous microbenchmarking experiments on the Pi platform, we furthermore report on a systematic analysis of response time fluctuations, and present lessons learned on dos and don'ts for replicable performance experiments.  2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - In this paper a system for measuring temperature in an FPGA structure is proposed. In this arrangement the Spartan-3 XC3S200 programmable FPGA device was tested and the popular small educational microcomputer Raspberry Pi, was employed as a control unit for the whole system. Part of the system was implemented inside the tested structure. There was an array of ring oscillators as temperature sensors and a structure for controlling the array. Ring oscillators are often implemented in FPGA devices. They are used both as single elements or an array of sensors for measuring the chip's temperature or path delay of SUT. The sensors can be located in different areas of the chip. In the case of this tested device 36 sensors were used, but generally, their number depends on the designer. The ring oscillator's frequency depend on the temperature, and the frequency of the activated sensor was measured outside with an oscilloscope. The Raspberry Pi controlled the measurement process via an SPI and the results were collected from the oscilloscope via a UART/RS232 interface. 2D and 3D visualizations of the frequency to temperature relationship were made using Gnuplot and Scilab. The results should visualize the temperature distribution inside the device, but first, the right calibration of sensors should be performed.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - An underwater remotely controlled vehicle is termed as an underwater rover as it is remotely controlled from the top of the host ship above the water surface. Now the working principle of an underwater rover is not similar to a remotely controlled car or drone. So, a steel cable is of great necessity for a proper connection between the user at the host ship and the underwater rover as this is a remotely controlled rover. There lies a great variety of its application, it can be used for getting the live video or still pictures of the underwater life and all the underwater activities to learn about the underwater life. It makes the job for divers, rescuers and gem collectors easier as the rover gives the pictures, live video and all the other relevant details necessary for having a proper knowledge about the underwater elements. The underwater rover engine can be built using many types but here we are going to discuss about Raspberry Pi controlled engine underwater rover; i.e; an ROV underwater rover using Raspberry Pi.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Nowadays, electromagnetic compatibility constitutes a serious problem for the design and operation of electronic and electrical components, devices or systems. The reason is that this physical phenomenon can affect the correct operation of all these facilities. It can cause the errors or failures leading to fatal consequences. Raspberry Pi 2 development platform which is becoming increasingly popular includes among influenced facilities. Many of scientist equipment is based on this platform because of low cost, relatively simple development and implementation. However, Raspberry Pi represents the fascinating device regarding electromagnetic compatibility. Therefore, it contains many potential sources of electromagnetic interference. A great number of things that can be realized by Raspberry should be able to resist to the electromagnetic disturbance which is also one of work outputs. The experiments with the device under test are performed using unique rooms, namely semi-anechoic chamber and gigahertz transverse electromagnetic chamber. Test chambers offer a practically perfect solution for electromagnetic compatibility because they are insulated from exterior sources of noise. Raspberry Pi is tested in near and far-field, and the results will help in the design recommendations to eliminate the interference level regarding electromagnetic compatibility. Currently, only several research publications are dedicated to electromagnetic compatibility of the development platform. It was the reason why the authors decided to create a paper provides information about this research field. The primary purpose of the paper reported here is to analyses the level of the electromagnetic interference and susceptibility in a near and far-field.  2018 Electromagnetics Academy.

N2  - Security in home is now being directed from traditional methodologies to automation with the help of Internet. The Internet of things is the network of interconnecting devices (may be physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, etc.) embedded with electronics, sensors, etc., to exchange data. Nowadays, home systems are equipped with computing and information technology which provides them with smartness and intellect. Since doors are the gateway to our homes, therefore it is necessary to make them more secure. Currently available mechanism of providing secure access to doors includes bare-metal locks and some smart locking systems. The smart locking systems performance can be evaluated on the basis of identification accuracy, intrusiveness, and cost. In this paper, we introduce the idea to provide secure access to home. It will be achieved through smart doorbell which is a cost-effective alternative to currently its counterparts. Our system connects WiFi-enabled Android devices with firebase server using Raspberry Pi and enables user to answer the door when the doorbell is pressed. It learns to identify new user by using face recognition as a unique identity to authenticate the individual.  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.

N2  - In order to weaken the barrier of implementation of speed limit enforcement in the country, ways to improve vehicle speed calculation such as image processing can be explored. It was observed that existing prototypes suffer with low effective frame rate, the average rate at which the system processes video frames, considering it unfit for real-time setup. In this study, a vehicle speed calculation system was developed on Raspberry Pi with Gaussian Mixture Model for vehicle detection and Kalman Filter for vehicle tracking on OpenCV, and was optimized with Sparse Random Projection on scikit-learn by projecting the video to a low-dimensional subspace. The prototype was tested and analyzed in performance, iun terms of effective frame rate, and in accuracy, in terms of vehicle speed, by applying paired t-test and linear regression analysis to prove if the optimization improved the performance and accuracy of vehicle speed calculation. It was found that Sparse Random Projection significantly improved the performance of the system at 7.08 fps and in effect improved accuracy with significant correlation between actual and calculated vehicle speed at an average absolute difference error of  0.76 kph. In contrary, vehicle speed calculation without optimization performed at 3.29 fps and  1.25 kph difference error.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Erica the Rhino is an interactive art exhibit created by the University of Southampton, UK. Erica was created as part of a city wide art trail in 2013 called "Go! Rhinos", curated by Marwell Wildlife, to raise awareness of Rhino conservation. Erica arrived as a white fibreglass shell which was then painted and equipped with five Raspberry Pi Single Board Computers (SBC). These computers allowed the audience to interact with Erica through a range of sensors and actuators. In particular, the audience could feed and stroke her to prompt reactions, as well as send her Tweets to change her behaviour. Pi SBCs were chosen because of their ready availability and their educational pedigree. During the deployment, 'coding clubs' were run in the shopping centre where Erica was located, and these allowed children to experiment with and program the same components used in Erica. The experience gained through numerous deployments around the country has enabled Erica to be upgraded to increase reliability and ease of maintenance, whilst the release of the Pi 2 has allowed her responsiveness to be improved.  2016 by the author.

N2  - This paper describes two state-of-the-art and portable voice-based authentication and language recognition systems. While the authentication system allows secure access to a media center at home, the language recognition system can be used as a previous step to automatically transcribe and translate the recognized text from its original language into another one. The most important advantage of the developed systems is that they can run on a low cost embedded device, such as a Raspberry Pi (RPi), and using only open-source projects, which makes it feasible to replicate or include in other systems, but also allows its implementation as part of educational projects in electronics. The developed systems have been tested on real data with very good results. Regarding the authentication system, the validation process is done in 3.3 seconds in average with an EER of 19% on test files with 20 seconds, and tested with up to 87 different speakers. On the other hand, the language recognition system is able to recognize up to six languages. For this system, important efforts were done in order to reduce the processing time and memory requirements while keeping high the recognition rate. The final system uses 64 Gaussians and 200 i-vectors, obtaining a Cavg error rate of 8.6% for the six languages.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most popular instruments in the medical field. Have been developed a smart IoT system for ECG Arrhythmia classification using Android device as the IoT Hub. In order to minimize the computing load on the Android device, some parts of the signal processing are moved to the data acquisition module by using Raspberry Pi 3 as the processor. In the Raspberry machine, a QRS detection system with Zero Cross Algorithm was implemented and its performance was measured. To measure the performance of the algorithm, a timer was placed before and after the execution of the process. The result shows that the algorithm can be run in real-time use in Raspberry Pi 3, although it is a bit slow and produced a high computational load of a single core processor in the machine.

N2  - The advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as low-cost embedded single board computers which integrate sensors, communication hardware, and processing power in one unit, has given more traction to the concept of Smart Cities. Having cheaper processing power at their disposal, the sensing units are capable of gathering increasingly larger amounts of raw data locally, which must be processed before being usable. One concern for this scheme is the amount of infrastructure and network bandwidth needed to transfer the data from the acquisition location to a server, which may be miles away, for further processing. The bandwidth available to the sensor network, distributed through the city, is expanding in a lower rate than the size and bandwidth demand of the network it serves. Therefore, transferring the unprocessed data to a central server does not seem feasible unless major compromises are made in terms of data resolution and size. This paper proposes a local big data based preprocessing scheme before the data is transferred to the storage. Using this scheme can free up the network bandwidth, exploit the otherwise wasted local processing power, and release processing load from the central server, allowing it to serve a larger network without the need for more powerful hardware. By making efficient use of network infrastructure the smart city applications are more affordable and scalable.  COPYRIGHT SPIE. Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.

N2  - We created an auto-para viewer, an autofluorescence imaging device, to localize the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy using an inexpensive Raspberry Pi. A special emission filter in the auto-para viewer was designed to pass 1/100 of visible light and nearly all infrared light longer than 808 nm. With this emission filter, we simultaneously acquired an autofluorescence image of the parathyroid and a visible light image of the surrounding surgical field. The auto-para viewer displayed four times brighter autofluorescence of the parathyroid glands compared to the background tissues without operating room light. Additionally, it showed two times brighter autofluorescence than the background tissues simultaneously showing the surgical field illuminated by the visible light from the operating room light. The NOIR camera, using the auto-para viewer, could reduce the camera's exposure time so the parathyroid glands to be viewed in real-time, which is expected to prevent unintentional damage to the parathyroid gland during thyroidectomy.  2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.

N2  - The technological and scientific advancement in the field of agriculture has opened a new era for design and development of modern devices for plant phenotype studies. To take advantage of recent advances in mobile technology, we built a low-cost point-and-shoot prototype camera called RPi Macro Camera, RMC, using for photographing macro images of plant. RMC consists of a Raspberry Pi computer equipped with adjustable CMOS camera modules easily to removed and replaced, as well as a lithium battery, and a 5-inch touchscreen liquid crystal display. The package size of the RMC measured about 130 x 100 x 100 mm3 and it weighed less than 600 grams. The total cost of the components was less than USD 150. The inexpensive camera, RMC, was tested on serial sections of wheat straw in different growth stages dyed with safranin O-fast green supported over microslides. Our prototype camera was direct photography with samples in conventional environment with power supplied from battery. The camera was able to obtain good-quality images for statistical analysis on red and green intensity associated with simple programming including image segmentation and color calibration. With modest improvements and further image processing algorithm, RMC is expected to be useful for a variety of plant phenotype studies.  2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

N2  - Renewable Energy Management System (REMS) is a device that can be able to monitor power through a microgrid. The purpose of this system is to optimize power usage that produced from renewable energy with the result that reduces power demand from the grid. To reach the goal this device manage the load power needs fully supplied by renewable energy when the power produced from renewable energy is higher than load demand, besides power surplus will be stored in battery in this way energy stored in battery can be used when it needed. When the power produced from renewable energy can not satisfy the power demand, power will supply by renewable energy and grid. This device uses power meters for record any power flow through microgrid. In order to manage power flow in microgrid this system use relay module. The user can find out energy consumption (consumed by the load) and production (produced by renewable energy) in a period of time so that the user can switch on the load in right time.

N2  - This paper presents design of a real-Time WebRTC-based video conference system implemented in Odroid embedded board. This research aims to design a low-cost video conference system but with sufficient quality for supporting distant teaching and learning activity. Evaluation of the system was conducted to measure performance of central unit (Odroid board) and video conference application when it was operated on both network with more than 3 Mbps of bandwidth capacity and less than 1 Mbps of bandwidth capacity between two places of around 1 kilometer apart. The results of the evaluation on the central unit show that the video conference application can be executed well in Odroid (50% consumption of CPU usage and 183 MB of memory usage). On the other hand, the results of the evaluation on video conferencing application show that the application can run well under bandwidth of more than 3 Mbps. On network with less than 1 Mbps of bandwidth capacity, the results show that the application can run quite well but with lower performances (higher delays and lower frame rate) with one category on PLR reached the value of 1.714%, exceeding the recommendation of ITU-T with value of 1%. The results of this research show that video conferencing application with sufficient quality of service can be implemented in Odroid.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Information Technology (IT), like other computing disciplines, is a largely software-oriented discipline, however teaching aspects of computing are significantly enhanced with hardware support. For example some programs use microcontrollers and low-level languages like C or assembly language to teach basic computer architecture concepts. Others use the flexibility of programmable platforms to teach basic discrete mathematics concepts. Yet other programs in IT recognize that the computing world is moving to different platforms, such as mobile platforms and the "Internet of Things" and choose to incorporate these systems in the design of their student educational experience. Using hardware in computing instruction enhances the learning experience for many students, especially those with learning profiles indicating a preference for active or experiential learning. Both Keirsey-profile (MBTI) 'Artisans' and 'Rationals' can benefit from this approach. A significant problem with using hardware-oriented tools to enhance learning is that students (and many faculty) in IT typically don't have a deep background in hardware design and debugging. Therefore hardware platforms must be selected which allow for development of learning experiences with ready-made and easy-to-use platforms. Platforms such as mobile phones epitomize this, as the hardware platform is complete and sealed, but includes a variety of sensors and interfaces, which offer versatile and flexible options for instructional development. Some single-board computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, offer extensive development support to minimize the need for hardware expertise, similarly a few microcontroller platforms, such as the Cerebot series and the Arduino series, offer extensive pre-built sensors and other interfaces, complete with software drivers and development systems, making them available to a software-oriented audience. This paper describes the educational concepts that lead to improved learning through incorporating hardware platforms. These principles are illustrated with several example applications that validate the principles.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.

N2  - This paper proposes a methodology for learning of languages programming using open hardware tools. It has chosen as study case, the teaching of Python language due to versatility, structure and robustness that this language provides in the design and construction of hardware and software elements in devices such as Arduino or Raspberry PI. However, this methodology can be employed in the teaching of other type of programming languages such as C, Java, or Dart. It has selected as educational framework of the methodology some sections of the model known as Stage Self Direct Learning (SSDL) which provides a conceptual base that serves as reference model allowing to build a methodology in which the students will be participant of their own educational process. In order to enhance the learning process in the students, in the structure of course, it has designed an e-learning course taking as platform to ILIAS (Integriertes Lern-, Informations- und Arbeitskooperations- System). It is an open source platform with some features such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) resources, forums, surveys, taxonomy services, exercises and assessment. During the development of course, different kinds of resources were created and shared through this platform, these were subject to discussion providing a space for the exchange of ideas and experiences associated with the main topics of this course. The methodology established allowed to encourage the interest of the students in the learning and use of programming languages as likewise using them in the design of projects that require the use of open hardware resources.  2016 IEEE.

To address this issue, a fast access protocol for ZigBee-enabled IoT devices is proposed in this paper, in which, the ZigBee module embedded in a registering IoT device could automatically obtain a Personal Area Network (PAN) address and instantly access the target ZigBee wireless network through the signaling interactions among the involved protocol entities. After that, the operation and control of the accessed IoT devices are conducted based on the ZigBee communications. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of this protocol, a prototype system is developed. The experiment and analysis results also have been shown to demonstrate the performance by comparing with the existing access methods.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Outwardly impeded individuals experience issues in travel and getting to data about open transportation frameworks. A few frameworks have been created for encouraging outwardly hindered utilizing the city transport. Most frameworks give double way correspondence and require expensive and complex hardware. The objective of this work is to decrease the troubles confronted by outwardly debilitated individuals while boarding in city transports, utilizing an intuitive remote correspondence framework. The framework contained a client module and a transport module to give an immediate coordinated association to diminish the existing challenges with a new many-to-numerous correspondence. When the client triggers the switch, the client module promptly conveys the data. In the event that the transport module gets the coordinated flag, it hums and shows the notice in the display to advise the transport driver that somebody is holding up to blind people on the transport. The intelligent remote correspondence help framework is a legitimate and minimal effort gadget for helping outwardly weakened individuals to utilize the city transports.  2017.

N2  - With rapid advances in the emerging and pervasive field of the Internet of Things, electrical and electronic engineering students need a robust grasp of embedded computational device principles to make a proper, appreciable and relevant contribution. This necessity is more pertinent in developing countries that are technologically lagging behind their developed counterparts. This paper analyses the teaching modalities and models used to teach embedded device theory. A new triumvirate (or three person group) hybrid blended learning model is proposed and used to instruct mid-level students in the Electrical and Information Engineering Department of the University of Nairobi; on two embedded device types: a custom board using an AVR Atmega88A series micro-controller and the Raspberry Pi single-board computer. Student circuit design ability and programming confidence prior and subsequent to the proposed method were used to assess the efficacy of the triumvirate model. From the preliminary iteration of the learning model program, it was found that the model is a viable method of ensuring persistent knowledge transfer of embedded design concepts and can be developed further.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - As computer platforms become more advanced, the need to teach advanced computing concepts grows accordingly. This paper addresses one such need by presenting XinuPi3, a port of the lightweight instructional operating system Embedded Xinu to the Raspberry Pi 3. The Raspberry Pi 3 improves upon previous generations of inexpensive, credit card-sized computers by including a quad-core, ARM-based processor, opening the door for educators to demonstrate essential aspects of modern computing like inter-core communication and genuine concurrency. Embedded Xinu has proven to be an effective teaching tool for demonstrating low-level concepts on single-core platforms, and it is currently used to teach a range of systems courses at multiple universities. As of this writing, no other bare metal educational operating system supports multicore computing. XinuPi3 provides a suitable learning environment for beginners on genuinely concurrent hardware. This paper provides an overview of the key features of the XinuPi3 system, as well as the novel embedded system education experiences it makes possible.  2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The explosion of multimedia applications within embedded devices has ensured that Image Processing and Machine Vision has now become a mainstream subject within most Computer Science and Electronic Engineering curricula. Yet often there exists a disconnection between the rapid prototyping tools that are taught within the laboratory to demonstrate concepts and those that are used for actual deployment in a stand-alone product. This calls for an approach whereby students are exposed to multiple levels of abstraction, in order to align the skill sets of our students with the requirements and expectations of industry. This paper describes the development of a senior level undergraduate course that introduces machine vision and image processing algorithms and implementation topics within the larger context of embedded computing. The key focus is that the student appreciates the theoretical concepts but is also capable of implementing them on embedded processors for prototyping or production.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly emerging as the next generation of communication infrastructure, where myriad of multi-scale sensors and devices are seamlessly blended for ubiquitous computing and communication. The rapid growth of IoT applications has increased the demand for experienced professionals in the area. Since few, if any, dedicated IoT courses are currently offered, most Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students will have limited or no exposure to IoT development until after graduation, and inadequately prepared in IoT development to enter into the workforce. Therefore, we have implemented an IoT-based learning framework to facilitate STEM undergraduate education. The design challenges of the novel learning framework are discussed in the paper. Subsequently, we established effective learning approaches to address the challenges. Specifically, we have introduced a lab development kit composed of RaspberryTMPi/ArduinoTMboards and sets of sensors with ZigbeeTMsupporting to provide wireless communication.  2017 ACM.

N2  - Incorporating hardware such as circuits with elements like sensors and actuators into online education platforms presents significant challenges, particularly when the learner and educator are not in the same location as one another. Open-ended design questions, can increase the challenges associated with assessment further still. In the past two years, we have been experimenting with ways to integrate varying degrees of automated grading and assessment for the hardware (circuits) designed and constructed by students in EECS-focused coursework at the secondary and undergraduate level, mostly in the context of embedded systems and controls using platforms like the Arduino/Teensy and Raspberry Pi. This work-in-progress paper briefly covers some ways we have gone about designing problems for hardware that can be assessed by online graders, lists a few example problem structures from several courses run over the past several years, and where we intend to take this work in the future.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has changed the traditional way of imparting education. Use of computers and mobile devices in classrooms made the teaching and learning process more interactive. However, educational institutions across the world have not yet exploited the full benefits of developments in ICT. A new breed of computing devices, called Single Board Computers (SBC), have flooded the market. These devices are being used by technology enthusiasts across the world for developing IoT (Internet of Things) projects. In this paper, we have presented the use of a SBC named Raspberry Pi in conducting theoretical and practical classes of Undergraduate programs in IT and related fields. Our case study proves that SBCs can be used to impart educa tion in interesting as well as environment friendly manner. This case study can be used as a basis for implementing higher education in economic way in poor and middle income countries.  Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

N2  - These Educational toys are important in early child development and motivate children to learn language. Numerous digital toys are now available in the children's educational toys market to help children learn foreign languages. However, a number of such technologies are expensive and the quality of usability is not at an acceptable level. The aim of the study is to develop a cost-effective, sustainable and danger-free educational toy for pre-kindergarten children aged between 4-5 years old to teach English as a second language in developing countries. This toy has been developed with Raspberry Pi and makes use of the RFID technology. The experiment in this research was conducted with 20 pre-kindergarten children for four weeks under the supervision of 14 teachers, using five games of the developed toy testing the prekindergarten children's learning of alphabet, words, colors, shapes, and numbers. A design-based research model with an innovation design method utilized during the development stage of the toy. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to evaluate the developed toy. The results of the experiment showed that the developed toy is user-friendly, and the pre-kindergarten children were enthusiastic about playing with it and learning was enjoyable. Also, the results showed that the developed toy can be suitable for use as an educational toy for pre-kindergarten children to teach English as a second language. The educational toy developed by the researchers will be beneficial for those who wish to teach English to pre-kindergarten children such as administrators, teachers and parents in developing countries.  2019, Kassel University Press GmbH.

N2  - In modern days, there is a need for an effective, smart, and quick teaching methodologies helping students to have intelligent and thorough knowledge experience. Effective teaching depends on deliverable methods and moral learning environment. New trends in this regard have raised the term Internet of everything (IoE) which connects machine, people, and processes. This paper offers an IoE-based solution to upgrade teaching and learning processes. IoE covers the entire digital age with miniaturized operating system devices serving easy integration of large applications on these tiny devices. We present an innovative approach for creating a smart learning environment, in which teaching resources are automatically operated after entering credentials through a Web application. Learning strategy also supports recording functionality wherein teacher can record the lecture contents and students can view recorded lecture series and can also interact through the collaborative screen. All modules are being controlled through embedded computing device Raspberry Pi for hardware interfacing, Web application, intelligent media for controlling the resources, and scripting module for the collaborative screen. As different features are integrated into a centralized zone along with a modest and easily operated interface, this system results as a worthwhile and helpful for both teachers and students.

N2  - The continuous dependency on technology has encouraged the integration of BeagleBone Black and C programming language in Universiti Tenaga Nasional in order to produce graduates that are active in the digital shift. The integration is introduced in the "Programming for Engineers" subject for first semester undergraduate students. However, the suitability of the syllabus as well as the integration needs to be observed. In order to achieve that, nine skills are set at the beginning of the semester, in which they will be assessed to observe their understanding of these skills at the end of the subject. The study is done for three different Bachelor degree programs in two consecutive semesters and the results show that they obtained at least 80% of the skills acquired. This impressive percentage has proven the suitability of the integration between BeagleBone Black and C programming language for the first semester undergraduate students.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - In the last decade, there has been a rapid growth in applying Augmented Reality (AR) and Internet of Things (IoT) as emerging technologies in linking physical and virtual objects for educational purposes. Realizing the complex concepts in a way that learner be able to interact with, will not only elevate the learning passion, but also has a significant positive role on learning performance and student's engagement. According to the aforementioned points, in this paper, we propose a color sensing AR-Based interactive learning system for kids which helps them to scan and explore the colors and learn their corresponding words in Spanish language. Our aim is to explore the role of such an AR-IoT-based system on students' learning performance. To do this, an embedded system including a color sensor and a raspberry pi board was implemented and provided for the kids. By placing the sensor on the specially designed colored book, the light's color frequency is measured and RGB code is sent over the cloud using MQTT protocol. On the web application side, color data is fetched from the cloud server and learners will be provided with a real-time feedback with the corresponding animations and multimedia content that teaches colors in Spanish language. Students' learning performance was assessed using paired t-test based upon the results of their pre-test and post-test, before and after interacting with the system. The successful experimental results were achieved proving the effectiveness of the system on learning performance.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Computing education research is built on the use of suitable methods within appropriate theoretical frameworks to provide guidance and solutions for our discipline, in a way that is rigorous and repeatable. However, the scale of theory covered extends well beyond the CS discipline and includes educational theory, behavioural psychology, statistics, economics, and game theory, among others. A computing education researchers journey towards appropriate and discipline relevant theory can be challenging and, when a researcher has learned one area of theory, it can be easy to return to familiar theory, as it may not be clear what the next step could be. The periodic table is a visual arrangement of the elements to group like with like, providing insight into how families of elements will react. Could we do the same with learning theories located in the domain of computer science education, and would it be useful? The working group will identify and survey existing literature on relationships between key areas of theory in computing education, identify ways of organising these research areas to show how knowledge of one could assist another, and produce initial graphical representations of theory and their relationship groupings to assist researchers in understanding how computing theory is currently used in the discipline and what theories might become of interest.  2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - This paper describes a four-week summer short-course designed to introduce students with limited hands-on technical experience to the low-level details of embedded systems and robotic Students start the course using a Raspberry Pi 3 to learn the basics of Linux and programming, and end the course by competing in a capture-the-flag type competition with the webconfigurable GPS-guided autonomous robots they designed and tested in the course. Throughou the course, students are introduced to programming languages including Python and PHP, advanced programming concepts such as using sockets for inter-process communication, data interchange formats such as JSON, basic API development, system concepts such as I2C and UART serial interfaces, PWM motor control, and sensor fusion to improve robotic navigation and localization. This course was offered to students for the first time in the summer of 2016, and though formal feedback collection was limited, informal feedback indicated that students found the course to be challenging, engaging, and beneficial to their overall understanding of engineering. The paper walks the reader through the background of this course. It then discusses the weekly lesson plans, supplemental material provided to the students, and our general strategy for teaching the course's programming and system design concepts in such an accelerated time frame. Finally, the paper discusses the student and instructor reactions to the course, lessons learned, and suggestions for future offerings. The material developed for this course will be posted online so that other educators may use it in their teaching.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

N2  - Computing education research is built on the use of suitable methods within appropriate theoretical frameworks to provide guidance and solutions for our discipline, in a way that is rigorous and repeatable. However, the scale of theory covered extends well beyond the computing discipline and includes educational theory, behavioural psychology, statistics, economics, and game theory, among others. The use of appropriate and discipline relevant theories can be challenging, and it can be easy to return to reuse familiar theory rather than investigate a new, more appropriate, area. To assist researchers in understanding how computing theory is currently used in the discipline and what theories might become of interest, we present in this paper a quantitative analysis of how learning theories are adapted in the computing education research communities. We search computing education venues for specific theory related keywords as well as for the citation of the influential paper describing each individual theory to identify popular theories and highlight gaps in use. We propose a template categorization of theories based on three main perspectives, namely, individual, group, and artefact, with several modifiers, and use this template to visualize general and computing education learning theories. To better understand theory connections we visualize the co-occurrence of learning theories in computing education research papers. Our analysis identifies three main theory communities focused respectively on social theories, experiential theories, and theories of mind. We also identify the strongest links within these communities, highlighting several avenues for further research.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - Due to the opportunities provided by the Internet, people are taking advantage of e-learning courses and enormous research efforts have been dedicated to the development of e-learning systems. So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we present an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We carried out some experiments with a student of our laboratory for delta type of brain waves. We used MindWave Mobile (MWM) to get the data and considered four situations: sleeping, relaxing, active and moving. Then, we used mean-shift clustering algorithm to cluster the data. The evaluation results show that our tesbed can judge the human situation by using delta waves.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - TechColleges, a project founded by the Federal State of Lower Saxony, aims at inspiring students at vocational schools to become a part of the first generation of academics. These students - being trained to teach at vocational schools - get support during their university courses with mathematical introductory courses and electrotechnical projects using small robots (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino). Robots have a great potential for motivating students excellently by linking electrical engineering with computer science. Positive impressions by using robots were received for projects like robotic summer program or robot lab project. Furthermore, there is a large number of available systems, like Lego Mindstorms or Robotino, which can be used in classrooms. TechColleges uses robots in university and classrooms to motivate students to become a teacher at a vocational school. The project consists of three levels, in which students are confronted with problems in the field of robotics and teaching activities. This paper describes the individual levels of the project. Level one depicts the obtained results. Level two and three give a preview.  2018, Springer International Publishing AG.

N2  - Due to the opportunities provided by the Internet, people are taking advantage of e-learning courses and during the last few years enormous research efforts have been dedicated to the development of e-learning systems. So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we design and implement an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We analyze the performance of Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol in an indoor scenario. For evaluation we considered throughput, delay and jitter metrics. The experimental results show that the nodes in the testbed were communicating smoothly.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, we propose an efficient three-module pedagogical system for embedded systems learning, which will provide students effective ways of learning embedded systems through basic concepts, current technology for hardware and software design, and team projects. The proposed pedagogical approach is based on systematic learning through evidence-based teaching, knowledge mobilization, and research strategies. In our approach, it is recommended to use two platforms, Vision (simulator) and one microcontroller (hardware), such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is a small (900 MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU) single-board computer developed by Raspberry Pi Foundation and Arduino is the most popular microcontroller (based on the ATmega328), which is a flexible and easy-to-use device for conducting various embedded systems projects. Those platforms have been used for many embedded systems projects, including home automation, IoT (Internet of Things), robots, games, and servers.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2019

N2  - Purpose - This paper aims to present the design and implementation of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based e-learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian operating system (OS). Design/methodology/approach - The testbed is composed of five Raspberry Pi B+ computers. The experiments are carried out in the department floor considering an non line of sight (NLoS) environment. Single constant bit rate (CBR) flows were transmitted over user datagram protocol (UDP), and data were collected for five metrics: throughput, packet delivery ratio (PDR), hop count, delay and jitter using the Iperf. Findings - The implemented testbed was evaluated using experiments. The experimental results showed that the nodes in the testbed were communicating smoothly, and by using attention value, the learner concentration is increased. Research limitations/implications - The performance of the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol was analyzed in a floor environment considering the NLoS scenario. However, this testbed can be implemented to other protocols also. Originality/value - Because of the opportunities provided by the internet, people are taking advantage of e-learning courses, and enormous research efforts have been dedicated to the development of e-learning systems. To date, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems, the e-learning completion rate is low. To deal with this problem, an IoT-based e-learning system was implemented to increase the e-learning completion ratio by increasing the learner concentration.  2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Lower-division courses in an Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology (ECET) program provide the background needed for introductory programming and embedded microprocessors. A C/C++ programming course emphasizes the software development process, language constructs, algorithms, and structured procedural design and possibly object oriented design. A microprocessor based course covers software design in C for input and output interfacing for various applications. For IoT applications, there is a need in upper-division courses to cover new, powerful, and inexpensive system-on-a-chip (SoC) devices that are capable of performing the responsibilities of a computer on a single chip and can be used in a variety of courses. One such device, the BeagleBone Black (BBB), is an open-source Linux platform that contains a variety of busses (SPI, I2C, CAN), general purchase I/O pins, serial ports, PWM outputs, and analog inputs. The intent of this paper is to demonstrate the usage of the BBB in a variety of upper division courses, illustrating several applications. Some potential courses include measurements and instrumentation, wireless communications, control systems, and advanced microprocessors. Labs covered with the BBB include digital and analog I/O operations, UART interface, TCP/IP interface, touch screen display, and student chosen end-of-semester lab projects. Programming is achieved using C++ and Python. Several of these labs will be discussed in this paper, along with schematics, configurations, and results.

Many advances have occurred in these machines over past decade in terms of new faster processors, energy efficiency, HD monitors etc. but the basic input devices such as mouse and keyboard remained the same. This project aims at giving a better mode of human computer interaction by allowing computers to respond to human hand gestures directly. The device aims at using the same interface that a mouse uses for interaction with a computer and thus it can be used in any computer without much modification to its software environment.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - Schools from all over the world are moving into the direction of using more e-learning, digital gadgets and BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). In the Estonian Strategy for Lifelong Learning 2020, the switch to 1:1 computing in classroom is called "Digital Turn". The strategy relies on expectations that smarter use of personal digital devices will improve not only digital literacy of pupils, but also their academic achievements in various subjects. The Estonian government plans to allocate 47 million Euros of national and EU structural funds until year 2020 for this purpose. There is also interest in improving digital skills of school-leavers on the side of the industry, as the Estonian ICT sector expects to double the turnover within the next 4-5 years. The sectoral analysis estimated the need for 8000 new employees in ICT companies. To achieve this, the industry has supported various educational programs like the Look@World Foundations Smart Lab project, Samsung Digital Turn project for schools, using Raspberry Pi-s at school supported by Transfer Wise, Microsofts Partners in Learning projects and so on. Challenges for the digital turn are related to peoples involvement (teachers, school leaders, students, parents, officers); resources (gadgets, time, salary, maintenance); promises (this is beneficial for improving the students skills and competences and also is the only way); lack of analysis (act more, measure less). In this article we will study the Samsungs Digital Turn project applications for the schools 2014 and 2015 in order to understand what are the goals for the schools when they think of digital turn; we also have asked school ICT administrators, educational technologists and school leaders to list seven issues that come into their mind that should be death with in the process, and surveyed teachers of one school over a 4-year period, tracking the changes in using technology as well as learning and teaching. We will analyze the data to understand the trends and difficulties schools will face during this journey. This information is needed to train all other 450 schools that have not started their digital turn change yet, but are forced to act soon. The trends in digital turn projects will tell us the maturing process and goals that the schools have as opportunities and strengths while the list of difficulties shows the projects weaknesses and threats. Looking at one school over 4 years will help us to understand the change, especially the areas that have changed in teachers practices. In the conclusion we propose a list of actions that can be used to meet the challenges that can ruin the digital turn for most schools. We also propose an area of measures where the digital turn is the most visible.  Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

N2  - Practical experience is an important aspect of the training of every engineer. One way to develop such experience is by hands-on laboratory experimentation which involves cutting-edge technology. In this paper, we present a signal processing lab experiment developed for undergraduate students. Throughout the experiment, students first learn the basics of adaptive filtering and implement an adaptive echo cancellation algorithm using MATLAB. Then, students use a software framework for implementing the same echo cancellation algorithm on a BeagleBoard development platform using both ARM and fixed-point DSP cores of an embedded system-on-chip from Texas Instruments. In a relatively short amount of time (8 hours at the lab and a few additional hours of homework), students learn an important signal processing technique, as well as use complex state-of-the-art DSP hardware to implement it as part of an application running in real-time.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - Background: Teaching bioinformatics at universities is complicated by typical computer classroom settings. As well as running software locally and online, students should gain experience of systems administration. For a future career in biology or bioinformatics, the installation of software is a useful skill. We propose that this may be taught by running the course on GNU/Linux running on inexpensive Raspberry Pi computer hardware, for which students may be granted full administrator access.Results: We release 4273, an operating system image for Raspberry Pi based on Raspbian Linux. This includes minor customisations for classroom use and includes our Open Access bioinformatics course, 4273 Bioinformatics for Biologists. This is based on the final-year undergraduate module BL4273, run on Raspberry Pi computers at the University of St Andrews, Semester 1, academic year 2012-2013.Conclusions: 4273 is a means to teach bioinformatics, including systems administration tasks, to undergraduates at low cost.  2013 Barker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - The fields of computer science and engineering are undergoing rapid change, with significant advances in areas including the internet-of-things, cloud computing, and blockchain technologies. Consequently, the gap between traditional course material taught to students in B.S./M.S. programs at universities and the cutting edge of technology used in industry is widening at an unprecedented rate. Students may get overwhelmed and discouraged by the amount of material they need to learn, contributing to high dropout rates in STEM fields, particularly in computer science and engineering.We propose a hands-on laboratory based approach to teach the students the basics of these emerging areas. The objective is to motivate and engage students by encouraging them to tinker with physical systems, so that they can develop an intuitive understanding of the new technologies.We present an approach using the Raspberry Pi, a small and inexpensive platform that allows students to build interesting applications in the area of the internet-of-things. We provide the preferred sequencing of necessary material, and the required combination of different software modules necessary to teach the students. We discuss our experience of teaching this course to both graduate and undergraduate students.Our results should be beneficial to instructors interested in exposing their students to these emerging technologies. Our main finding is that students prefer hands-on laboratory exercises to theoretical instruction. They are able to grasp concepts better when there is a short theoretical lecture followed immediately by related hands-on laboratory exercises. We present specific laboratory exercises to teach students about the end-to-end processing involved in acquiring images, creating immutable records using a cryptographic hash function, and transmitting and storing them on the cloud. These lab exercises provide students with an understanding of camera-based security applications, basic blockchain technology, and cloud computing.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - The ever increasing energy requirements of supercomputers and server farms is driving the scientific and industrial communities to take in deeper consideration the energy efficiency of computing equipments. This contribution addresses the issue proposing a cluster of ARM processors for highperformance computing. The cluster is composed of five BeagleBoard-xM, with one board managing the cluster, and the other boards executing the actual processing. The software platform is based on the Angstrom GNU/Linux distribution and is equipped with a distributed file system to ease sharing data and code among the nodes of the cluster, and with tools for managing tasks and monitoring the status of each node. The computational capabilities of the cluster have been assessed through High-Performance Linpack and a cluster-wide speaker diarization algorithm, while power consumption has been measured using a clamp meter. Experimental results obtained in the speaker diarization task showed that the energy efficiency of the BeagleBoard-xM cluster is comparable to the one of a laptop computer equipped with a Intel Core2 Duo T8300 running at 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, removing the bottleneck due to the Ethernet interface, the BeagleBoard-xM cluster is able to achieve a superior energy efficiency.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - Novelty detection consists in recognising events that deviate from normality. This paper presents the implementation of a real-time statistical novelty detector on the BeagleBoard-xM. The application processes an incoming audio signal, extracts Power Normalized Cepstral Coefficients and determines whether a novelty sound is present or not based on a statistical model of normality. The novelty detector has been implemented as a standalone graphical application capable of running in real-time on the BeagleBoard-xM platform. Experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the solution in terms of both detection performance and of real-time capabilities. The results demonstrate that the system is able to operate in real-time on the BeagleBoard-xM with a real-time factor equal to 8.10%, and an F-Measure equal to 77.41%.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - In today's environment, where every computer, including cell phones, are multicore, it is essential that students develop parallel programming skills. It remains a challenge to develop effective techniques for teaching parallel programing skills. Another challenge is finding time within already packed lectures to cover additional material. To that end, we investigate the effectiveness of using Project Based Learning (PBL) to teach parallel programming skills early in the curriculum by developing and incorporating a PBL module into CSc 3210 (Computer Organization and Programming). This is a core course taken by all computer science majors and is a prerequisite to many of our senior-level classes. In our case study, 124 students are organized into 26 diverse groups, with four or five students per group, and assigned five project assignments, each of two-weeks duration. Given a Raspberry PI, students will explore its multicore architecture and create programs for shared memory parallelism using OpenMP and C language. Our results show that incorporating this PBL module has a significant and direct effect on the student's growth in parallel programming skills. As a side benefit, we also show that there is a direct improvement on a student's personal growth in terms soft skills, which is essential in the professional development and success in the workplace. By having students experience PBL in an early class, close to the midpoint of the academic program, it can serve as a mini-capstone project. Furthermore, students can collaboratively learn by themselves (through teamwork) and apply the fundamentals of parallel programming skills without the need for separate lectures, labs, or workshops.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - In previous works, a widespread embedded platform, the BeagleBoard xM, was shown to provide sufficient through-put and acceptable latency for live music control and audio signals transmission on standard LAN and WLAN protocols. Although the preliminary work opened the way for further investigations, the software stack did not prove efficient enough to deliver stable audio performance below the perceptual latency threshold for good ensemble playing. This work reports on a custom Debian Linux image, called WeMUST-OS for the BeagleBoard xM, configured for the task at hand by careful low-level ALSA driver configuration with the DM3730 SoC and the TPS65950 audio codec to improve local audio input/output latency. Furthermore Jacktrip, an application for music audio transmission, has been modified with added support to resampling enabling seamless connection with other devices running audio at different sample rate and period size. Leveraging these two achievements, latency is shown to keep under perceptual threshold for ensemble music performance including transmission of the monitoring signal.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - As more and more ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) technologies pervade our daily lives, it is becoming increasingly important to train interaction design students to create these technologies. However, teaching students to design ubicomp technologies can be challenging, because creating a prototype, which people can use and students can learn from, usually requires a long setup and development phase. While there are some prototyping kits available, such as Arduino or the Raspberry Pi, they often require relatively steep learning curves before anything sophisticated can be prototyped. For this reason, we created UbiKit, a quick-to-setup, reusable, and affordable toolkit for the rapid design of ubicomp technologies that enable people to co-explore different scenarios and focus on the users. We piloted UbiKit in a Master-level course on ubicomp related topics and reflect on its potential to help streamline the prototyping and overall learning process for students being trained in our research area.  2017 Guldenpfennig et al.

N2  - The wheeled inverted pendulum robot has broad prospects of applications in real life. It can use two coaxial wheels to achieve the body self-balancing, forward moving and turning. But the general wheeled inverted pendulum robot seldom has vision function to perceive enviromental change. In order to realize the robust visual control, a wheeled inverted-pendulum vision robot with attitude sensors, photoelectric encoders, ultrasonic sensors and so on is designed based on Beaglebone Black board. The moving object is separated in the space domain by obtaining the image sequence which is sent by a robot-mounted camera, and the modeling, identification and tracking of target sequence are implemented in the time domain. The balance PD, speed PI and steering PD controllers are designed to realize the dynamic balance, forward and steering function of the robot. To satisfy the functional requirements of the visual tracking system, an improved tracking-learning-detection algorithm based on kernelized correlation filtering is used, and a tracking anomaly based on spatial context is detected to determine the tracking state and reduce the error rate. Experimental results show that the robot reaches the requirement of design and achieves better visual control effectiveness.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents a student project focused on designing a low-cost robot that can be used to teach dynamic systems and control. The robot is a two-wheeled balancing robot that is essentially an inverted pendulum. The robot is designed to carry a glass of water while performing various maneuvers such as line following. Students learn the importance of using feedback to stabilize the unstable inverted-pendulum system. The body of the robot was 3D printed. A low-level, real-time feedback control algorithm is implemented on an Arduino. The high-level control can be handled by a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi and Arduino can communicate over USB serial or i2c. The Raspberry Pi can be used to provide a wifi connection for the robot. Students also learn various aspects of Linux and Raspberry Pi in order to do the high-level control. The final cost for the robot is less than $250 and it makes a useful experimental system for dynamic systems and control courses. It could also be used to generate interest in dynamic systems and controls among prospective students.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

N2  - We present our approach to teaching functional programming to First Year Computer Science students at Middlesex University through projects in robotics. A holistic approach is taken to the curriculum, emphasising the connections between different subject areas. A key part of the students' learning is through practical projects that draw upon and integrate the taught material. To support these, we developed the Middlesex Robotic plaTfOrm (MIRTO), an open-source platform built using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, HUB-ee wheels and running Racket (a LISP dialect). In this paper we present the motivations for our choices and explain how a number of concepts of functional programming may be employed when programming robotic applications. We present some students' work with robotics projects: we consider the use of robotics projects to have been a success, both for their value in reinforcing students' understanding of programming concepts and for their value in motivating the students.

N2  - Teaching practicum is a learning phase that aims to complete the process of learning in higher education. In some educational institutions, teaching laboratories are not well facilitated, lack of tools, lack of maintenance staff, space and time which induce some problems in the implementation of the learning process. In this paper, a remote laboratory module for a grating experiment was introduced to solve some problem in maintaining the conventional laboratories. The remote laboratory module consists of a set of Practicum workbench, a grating (80 lines per mm), a laser source (645-655 nm, 3,0 mW), a camera and a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi was configured as a web server, workbench controller, and image pattern acquisition system. A user could choose the distance between screen and grating through practicum website page that developed using a bootstrap module. The grating pattern (dark and light) was captured using a camera and displayed as intensity versus distance (mm) graphic in practicum website page instantly. The proposed practicum module was evaluated to performed diffraction grating experiment to compute the laser wavelength by varying the screen and grating distance. The measurement results from the remote laboratory module are then validated with the data from conventional practicum which provides 0.5% error. Finally, the proposed remote laboratory module could be expanded for another practicum module in various field.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - System Dynamics and Controls class at Trine University had been handicapped by lack of equipment for experimental realization of concepts learned in class. A single existing Quanser setup ($5000 per unit) had been used for demonstration purpose but the students lacked the immersive experience a typical lab would provide. A similar, but more cost-effective equipment ($400 per unit), has been designed and seven units have been built and have been deployed in a laboratory setting. Three-four students share each unit. The hardware includes Raspberry Pi 3 (a credit card-sized computer), a 14-bit position encoder, a DC motor driver, and a 12V DC motor. The equipment bill of materials and some challenges during assembly are included in the paper. Labs have been developed based on the designed equipment and labs were run during Fall 2017 semester, with seven groups at 3-4 students per group. Topics covered in the lab include digital filtering, time domain and frequency domain characterization of first order and second order systems, feedback control of first and second order systems, steady state errors, control system design using root-locus and performance of PID controllers. A final project, which used the equipment, was undertaken by the students during the semester. A survey was conducted at the end of the semester to obtain students' feedback about how the equipment affected their learning of concepts in the course. The survey results showed that the equipment had positive impact on student learning. Based on the student performance in the final exam, and comparing it to the student performance last year, the student average has increased but did not increase statistically-significantly, mainly due to small sample size. For Fall 2018 semester, the group size will be two and the study will determine the effect of groups size on student learning.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly emerging as the next generation of communication infrastructure, where myriad of multi-scale sensors and devices are seamlessly blended for ubiquitous computing and communication. The rapid growth of IoT applications has increased the demand for experienced professionals in the area. Since few, if any, dedicated IoT courses are currently offered, most Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students will have limited or no exposure to IoT development until after graduation and entrance into the workforce. Moreover, there is a little room for adding additional courses into existing STEM curriculum. Therefore, we propose to transform STEM core courses by integrating IoT-based learning framework into their corresponding lab projects. The design challenges of the new learning framework is summarized in the paper. Subsequently, we propose the effective learning approaches to address those challenges. Moreover, in this paper, we present a case study by incorporating IoT-based learning framework into a Software Engineering (SWE) embedded system analysis  design course. Specifically, we introduce a lab development kit composed of Raspberry Pi/Arduino boards and a set of sensors with Zigbee supporting to provide wireless communication in the class lab section. We adopt module design method to design the course labware. Well-developed modules are presented and one sample module is illustrated in the paper. The labware is evaluated through survey questions. The majority of the students provided positive feedback and enjoyed the IoT-based lab development kit.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - The rapid development of e-learning and towards Massive Online Open Course requires the diversity of learning media as content. One type of learning media is interesting and easy to understand is multimedia learning media, especially video. In providing video content, an e-learning system requires high hardware and network availability resources. It certainly requires a lot of investment cost and resources. This research proposes solutions to these problems by designing and implementing multimedia servers with a simple network infrastructure that can provide video content and other multimedia-based learning media. Multimedia servers are created using single board microcomputer called Raspberry Pi that has a function as servers, and multimedia content will be accessed using smartphone devices by users. The advantages of this infrastructure are 1) Low cost but high performance approaching conventional servers; 2) Flexible and can be accessed via mobile using a smartphone. The result after performance measurement showed that CPU usage is approximately 10% from 1.2 GHz, the memory usage approximately 518 Mb out of 998 Mb, the network latency is still below threshold delay from TIPHON standardization, the video quality is still on the mini HD although accessed by 50 users, and the temperature is still in the normal levels.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Remote Laboratories are used in educational settings as tools to give students access to experiments that are not physically available to them at their institutions. During implementation, problems such as: bandwidth, security or limitations in terms of the usability, have been identified. This paper proposes an approach that integrates, what we call, a Smart Adaptive Remote Laboratory (SARL) with Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) to improve the students' experience by automatically adapting the experiments according to the student's current level of knowledge and experience. For this purpose, the laboratory experiment is connected with the VLE to access the student profile and academic information. This information is used by the SARL to adapt the educational content and the experimental interfaces accordingly. All students access the same set of equipment, but the adaptive system shows a variation of the graphic user interface with different controls and activities. The VLE provides the assessment component, completing the learning experience. The results of the experiments are stored in the remote laboratory system and sent back to the VLE to update the student information. A Raspberry Pi microcontroller and a web camera are used as hardware of the remote interface. The prototype software platform was implemented using Python and JavaScript languages and HTML 5 interface. The paper presents the design of the remote laboratory, the software integration model, and describes the details about the implementation of the prototype using this SARL strategy.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - While solid theoretical foundations are strictly necessary for any kind of engineering and scientific education, students benefit greatly from applications and practical examples to supplement their learning. Especially in engineering education, problem-based learning and laboratories are a centerpiece of higher education curricula [1] [2] [3]. Creating laboratories involves a lot of work for the educator as well as considerable investments in hardware. One of the possible solutions for this problem is the creation of remote laboratories where students can access a lab setup over computer networks. Thus, a single setup can be used by several lab groups as well as across different classes. However, this usually means that students have no physical access to the hardware and the setup adds little when compared to a simulation. Another solution to reduce hardware cost is low-cost mass market hardware [4]. In this paper, we propose that a single laboratory setup can often be used to demonstrate more than one concept. Thus, a mass market low-cost hardware setup can be leveraged across different classes, labs, and disciplines. This solution offers both a reduction in hardware costs due to the use of inexpensive hardware as well as a reduction in development time over individual setups for concept. In addition individual students or groups can have access to their own hardware to gain hands-on experience. As an example we present an embedded system that automatically tracks a ball with a camera. The setup shown in figure 1 consists of an Arduino Uno to control the motor that turns the camera and a Raspberry Pi which handles imaging and image analysis. The example can be used as a laboratory exercise for image acquisition and processing, controls, parameter tuning, system identification, testing, and deployment on embedded platforms.

N2  - In the early chapters of this book, we examined the Bonescript environment as a user-friendly tool to rapidly employ BeagleBone features right out of the box. In this chapter we revisited Bonescript and demonstrated its power as a rapid prototyping tool to develop complex, processor-based systems employing multiple BeagleBone subsystems. We carefully chose each of the projects to illustrate how BeagleBone may be used in a variety of project areas including instrumentation intensive applications (weather station), in assistive and educational technology applications (Speak-and-Spell), in motor and industrial control applications (Dagu robot), and calculation intensive image processing applications (moustache cam).

N2  - The widespread availability and prevalence of such platforms as Arduino, LEGO Mindstorms, Raspberry Pi, and auxiliary electronic plug- and-play modules and shields enable students to enter rapidly into different aspects of robotics design and prototyping. Nevertheless, a significant part of in-class robotics related activities at the current level of technological development has naturally shifted towards coding, placing a large part of fundamental issues to the background. While at the professional level this situation can be regarded as natural, given the complexity of tasks a modern robot supposed to perform, whereas at the introductory level, this approach appears to be as unreasonably one-sided, hiding much of inter-, multidisciplinary connections and basic fundamentals. From this perspective, the work provides an example of how the modern customary instruments, usually used in robotics classes could be supported through the use of additional means to preserve and cultivate its truly multidisciplinary character and mindset.

In the other hand, use of multimedia helps in better teaching and learning process. Companies like Hitachi, Panasonic, are manufacturing smart equipments which can efficiently replace the traditional blackboard. This design includes two modules viz. ARM9 board processor for unit which will be controlled by user i.e. teacher called handheld Unit hardware and Embedded Linux operating system for its software. Another module is remote unit which consist of Raspberry-Pi ARM 11 Board. Teacher has to write on a notebook sized touch screen which is interfaced with ARM9 handheld unit board. Written signals are converted into electrical signals and given to ARM11 board by using wireless RF module (Zigbee). Then Arm11 board controls and processes these signals and displays the written contents by the projector in large view by interfacing projector to HDMI port provided with Raspberry-Pi. This complete module makes classroom teaching more efficient and easy for the sake of students and teachers.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - One of the challenges for the people who live in the rural islands of the developing countries is the lack of access to education. Although ICT (Information and Communication Technology) is increasingly regarded as an essential tool to support learning activities in rural areas, the availability of telecommunication infrastructure in such areas is still problematic, primarily because of high implementation cost and low revenue. This study aimed to develop an e-Learning model for the community in the rural islands which utilize ship to deliver to and receive data from the island using store-and-forward communication technique over a transient long-range wireless link established when the ship is at a certain distance from the island. Here we focused on the design of a synchronization method between databases of multiple learning management systems (LMS) between the ship and the island. The design has been implemented and tested using Moodle installed on low-power Raspberry Pi computers. The result showed that our design is suitable to be used in such requirements, hence making it a feasible solution to support ICT-based learning for the people in rural islands.

N2  - A nomadic laboratory or testbed, based on Raspberry Pi 3 computers and Arduino microcontrollers, has been developed in order to teach subjects related to computer architecture. The testbed can be transported to the classroom. Students can access it through the available network, which can be a wireless LAN, wired LAN o a custom network. Students can access without constraints to the platforms, therefore there are a wide range of possible experiments. This laboratory was used during 2017 for practical works in the course Introduction to Technology, and during 2018 in two courses of Computers Architecture at Universidad Nacional of Cuyo and in a course of Wireless Networks at Universidad de Mendoza. Some of the experiments that are been carried out by students are: to explore and analyse the architecture of computers through Linux commands, write and run programs on different programing languages, input and output operations through memory mapped addressing and isolated addressing, write interrupt service routines in order to service interrupts, multithreading programing, explore memory maps, CPU features, etc. This paper describes the testbed architecture, experiments performed by students in the mentioned subjects, present the students feedback, and describes the possible methods in order to integrate it to a remote laboratory.  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - More than 64% of schools in Apurimac Peru are located in rural area; unlike the schools in urban area, they present problem of lack of Internet connection, hence, without access to virtual learning and they can't use Educational Resources. This paper describes the design, development and testing of the Mini Learning Management System for schools without internet connection to improve de availability of Educational Resources. The hardware used for this purpose was Raspberry Pi basic mainboard, with low cost and reduced size; on the other hand, Chamilo LMS was configured and optimized to run over the small mainboard. The proposal was evaluated by end users in Apurimac-Peru and they manifest their conformity with the tool to use educational resources and server functionality. In addition, performance tests were conducted, and the server responded reasonably to 200 requests simulating 10 different computers accessing simultaneously.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi platform provides true equal opportunity-of-use in computing globally. From it, new affordable research and industrial opportunities have emerged. To fully realise its driving potential, particularly in developing countries, a persistent knowledge teaching process for the Raspberry Pi is necessary. This paper presents a quasi-flipped learning model (QFLM) intended to spark critical and creative thinking and foster an entrepreneurial spirit early in a student's tertiary education life-cycle. The model was applied as part of a computer science component for third year students in the Electrical  Information Engineering (E.I.E) Department of the University of Nairobi. Student programming confidence and completion of a time-bound project were used as model assessment metrics. It was found that the Raspberry Pi, coupled with the learning model, is a viable catalyst for local innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - One of the primary goals of computer science education is preparing students to apply what they learn in the classroom to any problem they may encounter in the future. Due to the rapidly changing landscape of technology, regardless of the comprehensiveness of their coursework, at some point students will be required to apply their knowledge to a context they have not encountered before, and understand how what they have learned applies. One of the content areas where this is particularly relevant is helping students recognize the variety of technologies and applications in which object oriented design patterns can produce significant practical benefits. To foster this aptitude, we sought to leverage the students' own creativity with a Raspberry Pi and a multitude of sensors, displays, cameras, and actuators to boost exploration of technologies and student understanding of how course concepts apply outside of constructed examples. This paper presents the experience of using student creativity with the Raspberry Pi to drive their learning in an upper level software design patterns course.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to present the new, innovative teaching approach and tinkering pedagogy towards developing the students skills in STEM domains (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) with aim to the designing the laboratory for radiation detector development. Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and connectedness, and from another the concept of independent, self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can be used both in educational, and in the research and development purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching, hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity. The presented project integrate a Virtual Learning Environment, networking knowledge and student-owned movable laboratory on the chip, where radiation was used as a topic and where electronics was embedded and embodied.  2015 RAD Conference Proceedings.

N2  - In order to further education in embedded discovery, Protomesh (prototype mesh) seeks to improve the field by providing a wireless solution for deploying Raspberry Pi workshops. Protomesh is a platform for starting up a quick ad-hoc batman-adv network. Batman-adv is an open source, kernel module native to Linux that provides a layer two mesh network routing protocol [2]. We leveraged this technology during Raspberry Pi workshops to use as a wireless infrastructure where students could freely access their Raspberry Pi across the mesh network. Network technologies such as this provide both an interactive and enriching experience. Protomesh enhances this experience by providing a solution for wireless connections and removing the burden of tethered Raspberry Pis. By allowing students to experience Raspberry Pi's wirelessly, students are enabled to explore a new horizon of embedded education.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The study of cluster computing and its applications are vital to the future of computer science. By linking a group of computers to provide more processing power than one computer can alone, this is the principle upon which modern supercomputers are built. This short paper describes a student's learning experience in cluster computing. As part of the Texas Woman's University's Quality Enhancement project, the student received funding to purchase computing components to create a low-cost cluster computer using 5 Raspberry Pis. The data collected from experiments running on the cluster computer is compared to those from a single Raspberry Pi. The results from those experiments are presented in the paper.  2017 ACM.

N2  - The objective of this 'work-in-progress' paper is to describe a Raspberry Pi based learning center management system that assists in deciding resource allocation for a peer-instruction driven engineering tutoring center. Data gathered from the usage of the engineering tutoring center allows for cost-effective staffing through recognition of the center's usage trends. The data collected may be structured per the center administrator's requirements and presented real-time on dashboards. The flexibility of this Raspberry Pi system allows for it to be developed into a full fledged learning management system with integrated analytics as required for a particular curriculum. This system is highly cost-effective as compared a commercial web-based system. This prototype has saved approximately 12 hours a month of time, for data retrieval and analysis as compared to a previously used commercial web-based system. At the moment, this Raspberry Pi data tracking system has been installed only in a single tutoring center on-campus. Deployment of this across a university campus would allow accumulated usage trends to be examined through data analysis operations such as seasonality and trend decomposition.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper describes a pilot study to evaluate its use for teacher Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in Computer Science (CS) using the Bridge21 model, a particular model of 21st century teaching and learning. A range of introductory Computer Science workshops are evaluated that include topics such as; Computational Thinking, Scratch, Raspberry Pi and Python. This paper includes a detailed look at the generalized activity model used in all Bridge21 activities. Combining the Kirkpatrick training evaluation theory with ethnographic methods the researchers analyzed qualitative and quantitative data gathered from 110 in-service teachers whom attended 9 CS CPD workshops. Using the Kirkpatrick framework as a taxonomy with which to code data relating to (a) teachers initial reactions towards the workshops and (b) intentions towards use of the Bridge21 model for supporting CS classroom delivery. Findings indicate that teachers initial reactions towards the programme were positive and that teachers intend to use the model in their classroom.

N2  - During the last years many virtual laboratories have been developed, but not all of them were successfully adopted. Designing, planning and creating a virtual laboratory can be a very difficult process, which can get even more complicated if the laboratory has to provide access to real equipment. One of the most problematic steps when developing such virtual laboratories is the selection of the right access method. At the present moment of time there are many technologies that allow users to access devices remotely. One of these possible solutions is to use the Telnet/SSH protocols for remote access. Nevertheless, the use of these protocols require at least one active network interface per device, which in some cases can present a problem. There are some other drawbacks of using Telnet/SSH for remote access as well - virtual laboratories are often created with the purpose to be used in the education process, which means that the users of these systems in most cases are students. These less experienced users might accidently delete the configuration of the interface that is dedicated for the remote access, which will result in the immediate loss of connection to the device and will require administrator intervention to fix this access issue. An alternative solution to provide remote access is to use a console server. A detailed analysis on the possibilities for remote access using console servers, present them as reliable, but also as a very expensive solutions. In this paper we will investigate the possibilities to replace the expensive console servers with much cheaper devices. One such device is the Raspberry Pi - a low cost device that was developed to enhance the education process of children and students in the field of the computer sciences and their related subjects. In this paper we will investigate and compare the characteristics of the Raspberry Pi to the most widely used console servers and we will present a way to use the Raspberry Pi as a console server for remote access to telecommunication routers and switches.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - This paper shows the building of an embedded Asterisk platform as a key technique for providing Information Technology classes with an extra laboratorial environment for learning Voice over Internet Protocol. Besides building the platform, the students are asked to mount a functional telephony system with it that meets the criteria of low cost, low building complexity and high adaptability to convergent networks. The Raspberry PI version B was the board used to provide portability for the students to work outside the laboratory environment. Asterisk was presented as a useful tool on which the students could create a flexible system that could be easily deployed on convergent networks. This work was developed in the Telephony subject for the Electrical Engineering and the Telecommunications Systems undergraduate courses from the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Paraiba - IFPB, and presented good results in the students' learning achievements.

N2  - This paper describes the ideas of using Raspberry Pi computers in high schools and higher education. Raspberry Pi is a powerful computer in a size of a credit card. It was created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation charity, whose primary goal was the re-introduction of computer skills learning among students. The Raspbian operating system is based on Linux and offers an excellent working environment for students, as it includes software solutions designed to expand students' knowledge of computer science in an interesting way. Besides computer science knowledge, it is also suitable for acquiring basic knowledge in electronics. It is also very important to have the possibility of interconnecting such acquired knowledge. Our students have adopted the knowledge how to install and use the Raspbian operating system, how to network and connect to the Internet, how to write programs using the Python programming language, and how to develop hardware-based projects. From our own experience in Raspberry Pi we can conclude that this is an ideal platform for students to acquire new knowledge and competences in the field of computer science and electronics.  42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2019 - Proceedings.

N2  - This article presents an alternative architechture implementation with the purpose of provide real experiments of remote access and expand teaching practices focused on experimentation toward physics education. The research uses a low cost open hardware and an available multiplatform with open source applications. With this initiative, lab resources can be accessed from schools, as many of them have not appropriate science lab for practical activities. This reserch have been applied in two public schools from Ararangua/SC that also face difficulties when using the computer lab. As a solution, the students use their own mobile devices to do science and physics experiments accessing, controlling and observing real experiments installed in the Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab). Making new experiments is a collaborative work with the teachers of these schools and with the lab staff to adapt their idea to a low cost system with the Raspberry Pi. The study presented here intends to facilitate the experiments adaptation and motivate other research labs to make their experiments available.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi is a single board computer (SBC) priced at 35 USD  less than the cost of many textbooks. The current model (3B) includes a quad-core ARM 64-bit CPU, 1 GB of RAM, a 2-core GPU, and numerous communication ports, including USB, HDMI, Ethernet, WiFi and Bluetooth. This combination of low cost and high functionality creates many new pedagogical possibilities for CS educators, ranging from using the Raspberry Pi to teach assembly language to using it as a multiprocessor. Relatedly, mathematics educators have produced an extensive literature on the use of pedagogical tools known as "manipulatives" that have been shown to be effective at starting students through a "concrete, representational, abstract" progression of understanding of an abstract topic (e.g., [1-5, 7]). In this approach, students interact with a manipulative that provides a "concrete" representation of a mathematical abstraction; subsequent pedagogy using representations of the abstraction (usually pictures) help the student start building a mental model of the abstraction; further pedagogy using a symbolic representation helps the student extend their mental model and progress to a more nuanced understanding of the abstraction. The basic idea dates back to Papert, who called manipulatives "objects-to-think-with" [6]. Subsequent research has shown this approach to be effective at improving student mastery of a wide variety of mathematical abstractions, ranging from algebra [2], to fractions and ratios [4], to computation and problem-solving [1,3]. Other researchers have noted that manipulatives can make learning enjoyable and fun [5]. We believe this same "concrete, representational, abstract" progression can be used to help students master many CS topics that are often taught as abstractions. More precisely, the Raspberry Pi can be used as a manipulative to provide students with a concrete representation of specific CS topics ranging from CPUs to primary vs. secondary storage to distributed multiprocessors; topics that would  in the absence of a concrete representation  remain fuzzy abstractions to students. By providing a "concrete" foundation on which to build, a SBC like the Raspberry Pi (R-Pi) can provide the first step in helping students build mental models of such abstractions, and thus enhance student learning. Like [5], our experience also suggests that many students find the R-Pi to be a fun and enjoyable way to learn about these abstractions.  2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - The recent development of the Raspberry Pi mini computer has provided new opportunities to enhance tools for education. The low cost means that it could be a viable option to develop solutions for education sectors in developing countries. This study describes the design, development and manufacture of a prototype solution for educational use within schools in Uganda whilst considering the social implications of implementing such solutions. This study aims to show the potential for providing an educational tool capable of teaching science, engineering and computing in the developing world. During the design and manufacture of the prototype, software and hardware were developed as well as testing performed to define the performance and limitation of the technology. This study showed that it is possible to develop a viable modular based computer systems for educational and teaching purposes. In addition to science, engineering and computing; this study considers the socioeconomic implications of introducing the EPi within developing countries. From a sociological perspective, it is shown that the success of EPi is dependant on understanding the social context, therefore a next phase implementation strategy is proposed.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - By design, the computer science curriculum for undergraduate students in the United States does not include enough hands-on courses such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. It is difficult for students, especially the Distance Learners (DL) to appreciate the power of computer science as a problem-solving field without real-world experiments. Furthermore, students in computer science may drop-out or turn away from the field because it does not offer an opportunity for them to communicate with each other during online/traditional labs. In this paper, an active learning project-based approach in online/traditional computer science courses is introduced to make the courses' material more attractive to students from minorities. Students obtain a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world problems. Students will enjoy the challenges they face when developing solutions. This paper studies the impact of hands-on project-based learning using Raspberry Pi on students taking online and face-To-face computer science courses at Old Dominion University.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - With the requirement that parallel  distributed computing (PDC) topics be covered in the core computer science curriculum, educators are exploring new ways to engage students in this area of computing. In this paper, we discuss the use of the Raspberry Pi single-board computer (SBC) to provide students with hands-on multicore learning experiences. We discuss how the authors use the Raspberry Pi to teach parallel computing, and present assessment results that indicate such devices are effective at achieving CS2013 PDC learning outcomes, as well as motivating further study of parallelism. We believe our results are of significant interest to CS educators looking to integrate parallelism in their classrooms, and support the use of other SBCs for teaching parallel computing.  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The aim of this work is to create a working GPS tracker for cars with a web administration interface. The web application design was based on the similar solutions that already exist and needs of potential users. The GPS tracker is based on Raspberry Pi 3 board, which is widely available and is a perfect learning tool for students wanting to learn basics about software-hardware interaction. Whole work was divided into simpler tasks, which could be solved on a regular week basis. Students were divided into two groups based on their preferences. Main task for the first group was to assemble and program the GPS tracker based on the Raspberry Pi Zero board using GPS and GSM modules. The second group needed to develop a web application which will store and manage data from the tracker. The complete solution was then tested with real data and evaluated by real users. Students were then given a questionnaire to provide feedback on this type of group project and the results were mainly positive.  2018 IEEE.

The AOLME project uses an integrated curriculum that relies on the use of basic concepts from middle-school mathematics to teach the foundations of image and video representations. The middle-school students, mostly from underrepresented groups, learn how to program their own video representations using Python libraries running on the Raspberry Pi. Overall, we have found that the students enjoy participating in the project.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - This paper describes how low cost but innovative hardware device as Raspberry Pi can be used in education as a tool for an implementation of generalizing project. The use of this device helped students apply what they have learned during their bachelor's degree. At the end of the project all 45 students completed a survey. Between 80 and 90% of them evaluated the ability to use Raspberry Pi and implementing what they have learned so far to develop a relatively finished product as a motivation to continue working in the same field. Interestingly, almost 90% are pleasantly surprised by what has been achieved. They would also like to continue to develop this project on their own or start a similar project as a diploma project. More than 95% of the students are very satisfied from their own results and also from team working. We evaluate these results as promising.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Most universities are still using microprocessor training board that equipped with Intel 8086 to introduce students about assembly language and computer architecture due to its popularity and availability. The Intel 8086 is the first x86 microprocessor, it is no longer suitable to introduce students to the modern x86 architecture. A new microprocessor that featured modern architecture design is needed to maintain the competency of university students to keep pace with the fast advancing computer technology. Intel Galileo is a single board computer board that equipped with Intel Quark X1000 SoC. We successfully developed new approach for programming the device using assembly language. Supporting lab materials, example codes, macros, and procedures are developed to incorporate the Intel Galileo board into the laboratory experiments design for microprocessor course. The proposed laboratory experiments allow undergraduate students to learn IA-32 instruction sets and protected mode programming. The results from pre-post-test and quantitative survey shows that Intel Galileo board is effective to support the learning of the IA-32 assembly language and computer architecture.

N2  - This paper presents the idea about how to combine a set of software and hardware resources available in literature to be used as support to control engineering education. The available tools allow to mix topics related to programming, communications, operating systems, and control theory. The well-known Raspberry Pi board is used as platform to exploit the different proposed concepts. SciPy, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries, which are Python-based open-source libraries for scientiffc computing and graphical representation, are used to perform Matlab-like simulations and to implement classical control loops. On the other hand, virtual processes developed in Easy Java Simulations are adapted to be controlled through the network from a controller implemented on the Raspberry Pi with Python. This option is very useful from a teaching point of view since time-based, networked-based, or event-based control approaches can be easily introduced on this proposed architecture. Furthermore, once students know how to implement control loops on the Raspberry Pi using Python, external real processes can be easily controlled by using the GPIO interface available in the this electronic board. Then, a project based on these tools and ideas is motivated and presented in this paper to control a two-tank level process.  2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Nowadays the control education usually heavily relies on the available simulation packages and virtual laboratories, both of which have their irreplaceable position in the educational process. But unfortunately the closed loop experiments are way too often limited to these virtual domains and the students lack the physical feedback about the impact of control algorithms and its parameters. The reasons might be the price of the hardware setup to demonstrate the control algorithms physically or a complicated transition from simulation to real-time platform. This paper describes an extremely inexpensive, straightforward and surprisingly powerful platform for implementation of real-time control algorithms. The platform consists of an Arduino board and a Raspberry Pi running the REX Control System. The Arduino board is used for interaction with the physical world via its inputs and outputs. The REX Control System allows the students to develop and verify the control algorithms in Simulink and then run it in real-time by a few mouse clicks. However, the REX Control System is by no means dependent on Simulink, it is fully functional even if Simulink license is not available. The platform further bridges the gap between the virtual and physical worlds as it is tightly connected to PIDlab.com and Contlab.eu portals, which makes it an ideal choice for control education purposes.

N2  - This full paper proposes an educational methodology to teaching and learning of programming using both open hardware tools and industrial components such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, three phase motors and variable speed drives. The methodology aims to improve the algorithmic thinking in the students due to the deficiencies detected in it, as well as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language, using hands-on designs and activities that require the components mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for students of technology in electronics (n = 22), observing that the students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation and engagement towards the software area was increased during the course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming language Python in order to interact with the different ports, peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design, e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects, firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly, programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering but in turn, it has a ubiquitous nature in the areas mentioned.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper firstly describes the development and evaluation of a project course which yields university students building a complete hardware and software chain for a digital image processing application. To arouse the interest and learning initiative of students, we propose them to build a setup including a Raspberry Pi and image processing programmes. This inexpensive single board computer answers todays issues in energy saving and permits to review fundamental hardware and software principles. Secondly, we propose a low-cost setup for a time-limited practical work: a Raspberry Pi is shared and controlled remotely by several student pairs: we emphasize the interest of collaborative work, and we provide knowledge and skills about micro-computers to a large number of students simultaneously.

N2  - With the development of the teaching and research of big data processing and distributed algorithms, there emerges an increasing need to leverage low-cost hardware to build the distributed computing test environment for the purpose of the algorithm validation and experiment simulation. In this paper, we propose a distributed computing testbed using the affordable Raspberry Pi board as the basic computing unit. We develop a cluster platform by building and assembling the units, and design a containerized service-computing framework by merging LXC and service computing techniques. Three kinds of services are introduced and configured to implement specific workflow orchestration on demand. For convenience, we develop a visualized user interface to manage cluster, deploy service containers, and manage workflows. We present the containerized service workflow that links the components of data source, distributed data processing and visualization, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed testbed.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Sustainable Environmental Development is one of the hot topics nowadays. Industries were advised to reduce and control pollution by using pollution control equipment. Computers are also contributing some amount in the pollution and power consumption. On the other hand, miniaturization, less power consumption, and environment-friendly devices are invented by the researchers every day. One such device is Raspberry Pi. Size of the Raspberry Pi is not bigger than a credit card with high computing capacity and low power consumption. Pi can run Linux as well as Windows 10 in its higher versions. This paper aims to suggest the Pi can be used for practicing most of the laboratory courses in the computer science engineering curriculum. Most laboratory courses are practiced in C, C++, and Java languages. Apart from above-mentioned languages, some laboratory courses make use of front end and back end tools. Above-mentioned languages can be executed in Raspberry Pi. Following points are analyzed between normal computer and Pi, execution time, power consumption, and environmental effect. In all the comparison, Pi gives much higher advantage over existing system.  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

N2  - In this paper, we explore the Raspberry pi 2 B+ (RPI) graphics in terms of electrical power and energy. We use a novel method to correlate graphics processing, CPU load and electrical power consumption and total energy. By using different benchmarks both with and without the GPU rendering and a Power Gauge, the power consumption difference between GPU rendering and software rendering can be measured. Our results are showing that the number of frames rendered per second increases dramatically when hardware rendering is used, as does electrical power. Interestingly, because the hardware rendering takes less time, we have found that the total energy consumed per rendered frame can be lower despite the electrical power during hardware rendering being higher.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - In Information Technology (IT) education, hands-on experience through the lab is crucial because students tends to learn thing better when observing how practically it's been applied in real system. In general, the lab in IT education requires a variety of equipment such as PCs, servers, switches, and etc., which are relatively expensive. Due to this reason, virtual environment has played a big role in IT education since virtually multiple systems can be created, modified, tested, and deleted easily with little or no cost. However, virtual system still requires at least one PC and its capability is limited to providing additional Operating System (OS). Recently, emergence of Raspberry Pi provides a small and affordable computer, which is utilized in many different areas. This emerging technology has not been explored well to be adopted in IT education. In this paper, we will introduce and investigate Raspberry Pi and discuss its effectiveness in IT education. We will also introduce the building process of a low cost hands-on lab environment setup using Raspberry Pi.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.

N2  - The 2013 ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines highlight the importance of teaching parallel computing to undergraduates in higher education. Universities have responded to this need, but there remains a hole in most curricula. While techniques for parallelizing code and using tools such as MPI and OpenMP seem to be well covered, concepts of shared versus distributed memory and race conditions are often taught only at an abstracted level. Using the educational operating system Embedded Xinu, students can write ARM assembly code that makes use of instructions meant specifically for multicore interaction. By having students implement exercises such as the coupon collector's problem, they can gain a much deeper understanding of potential issues with sharing memory and maintaining cache coherence. This added curriculum fits with existing computer organization courses and helps to prepare students for future work in parallel computing. This paper presents specific enhancements used with the Embedded Xinu operating system and its associated ARM Playground, as well as a pilot study using the new curriculum with undergraduates in a typical hardware systems course.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Bridge21 is a particular model of 21st Century teaching and learning and this paper describes a pilot study to evaluate its use for teacher Continuing Profecional Development (CPD) in Computer Science (CS). The CPD programme covered a range of introductory Computer Science topics including; Computational Thinking, Scratch, Raspberry Pi Input/Outputs and Python. The researchers combined training programme evaluation theory (Kirkpatrick, 1994) with ethnographic methods (Fetterman, 1987) to analyze qualitative and quantitative data gathered from 110 in-service teachers whom attended 9 CS CPD workshops. The Kirkpatrick framework was used as a taxonomy against which to code data relating to (a) teachers reactions towards the CS CPD programme and (b) intentions towards use of the Bridge21 model for supporting CS clacroom delivery. A combination of coding procedures generated four themes that addrec two research questions. Question one explored to what extent the 21st Century learning model proved effective for CS CPD programme delivery, while question two explored the extent to which teachers intended to use the learning model for delivery of CS topics in the clacroom. Findings indicate that teachers' initial reactions towards the programme were positive and that teachers intend to use the model for their CS delivery.

N2  - Excluding hands-on experience with physical plants from control education is tempting in many aspects, but at the same time it is very dangerous. This paper explains why and recommends a compromise between demanding maintenance of physical plants for students to control and relying on pure numeric simulations within the whole curriculum. The golden mean might be the use of real-time simulators with physical inputs and outputs, i.e. hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulators. Three examples of HIL simulators are presented, covering a coupled tanks model, a quarter-car model and a nuclear reactor model.  2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - It is widely recognized that motivating students in an undergraduate assembly language course is a tremendous challenge, principally because of the perception that the subject matter is both difficult and tedious. The Raspberry Pi is a small and inexpensive single-board computer that was created for educational purposes, and in this paper we describe how we successfully incorporated this device into the curriculum of an undergraduate assembly language course. We describe, in detail, the objectives for this course and the dedicated lab that uses the Raspberry Pi as an embedded device, and then evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings (obtained by exploring changes in student performance and examining the results of an engagement/enjoyment survey) strongly indicate that the introduction of the Raspberry Pi was well received by the students and contributed positively to their learning outcomes.  2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - In this paper, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) parking management solution for roadside parking spaces. This solution includes software and sensor hardware installed at each parking space. Because the smartphone is prevalent nowadays, we also design a smartphone application to enable users to easily access information regarding parking spaces near the users destination and devise the best path to it anytime, anywhere. We choose Apple iOS as the programming platform on the smartphone and Raspberry Pi 3 as the sensor hardware, which uses an infrared distance sensor to determine whether the parking space has been occupied by a vehicle or not. We also adopt Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to connect sensors of all roadside parking lots and build a BLE mesh sensor network to collect parking statuses. A routing protocol for the BLE mesh sensor network to efficiently forward parking information to the parking management server is proposed in this paper. Finally, we present the software and sensor hardware used for implementing this parking management system, the simulator to execute the proposed BLE mesh routing algorithm, and snapshots of the parking app.  MYU K.K.

N2  - Instructional laboratories are common in engineering programs. Instructional laboratories should evolve with technology and support the changes in higher education, like the increased popularity of online courses. In this study, an affordable and portable laboratory kit was designed to replace the expensive on-campus equipment for two control systems courses. The complete kit costs under $135 and weighs under 0.68 kilograms. It is comprised of off-the-shelf components (e.g., Raspberry Pi, DC motor) and 3D printed parts. The kit has two different configurations. The first (base) configuration is a DC motor system with a position and speed sensor. The second configuration adds a Furuta inverted pendulum attachment with another position sensor. These configurations replicate most of the student learning outcomes for the two control systems courses for which they were designed.  2016 by the author.

N2  - The paper presents an engineering design approach to develop an instructional module for college students to learn Microprocessors and Robotics using multiple sensors, microprocessors and software design tools. The module consists of research analysis, lesson content development and laboratory practice selection, which satisfies the ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering  Technology) requirement for engineering education. The research analysis covers the work reported by the scholars from MIT and other universities [1] [2], where the main concern is how to enhance students' capability in developing engineering products using new technologies in the industry, such as multiple sensor fusion methodology as well as working skills on cross-platform hardware (Intel, ARM, AMD and PIC, etc.) and software (Linux, Windows and Androids, etc.). After the research paper analysis, a class activity has been developed. The activity includes teaching students to build teaming robots by combining the Cortex controllers with ROBOTC programming environment under Windows and the Raspberry Pi (in ARM cores) using Python under Linux and guiding students to develop a cross-platform software and hardware design using PIC Microcontrollers with embedded C under Windows and the Raspberry Pi with Python under Linux. The teaming robots under development contains a leading robot and a tracking robot. The leading robot in the front can turn in any direction. When it "sees" an obstacle ahead using an ultrasonic sensor, it will turn left or right to avoid the obstacle. The tracking robot has a Cortex controller to drive the motors and an ultrasonic range finder to detect the distance between it and the leading robot. At the same time, the tracking robot also holds a Raspberry Pi board with a Pi Camera on it. The image signal obtained from the Pi Camera is processed by the Raspberry Pi and sent to the Cortex controller. Based on the processed image signal, the second robot can follow the first robot to turn accordingly, thus, they make a robot team. The exercise package contains a PIC microcontroller with a speaker and the Raspberry Pi with Pi Camera. If the Pi Camera finds some motion around, a signal will be sent to the PIC microcontroller and the siren sound will be emitted. The activities largely aroused students' curiosity and attention. The survey result is very encouraging. After the class, students' enthusiasm in learning Python, image processing and engineering design using multiple boards and programming languages as well as the applications has been noticeably enhanced.

N2  - Radio amateurism is a hobby, which helped in pioneering many innovations that we are using today. Hobbyists, which use radio communication to communicate, are called Hams. Radio communications has great history and Hams are part of it. Radio amateurism is a hobby which plays great part in emergency and disaster relief situations when conventional communications became unavailable. Technology built around radio communication is suitable in education to test study cases, and gain knowledge in wireless and computer communications. Purpose of this paper is to experiment with open source VOIP software (svxlink) using, cheap microcomputer hardware, one of available Linux distributions, radio amateur frequencies, radio amateur transceivers and antennas. Different technological issues brought together in this paper such as wired and wireless communication, VOIP over Internet with voice coming from radio amateur equipment and vice versa. We also tested integrated automatic position reporting system (APRS) because svxlink has capability to dynamically update data on APRS server what is capability with potential many applications such as active and passive measuring activities of VOIP users, users' mobility, and other applicable APRS functionalities as well. In this paper are published experiences from real disaster situation during floods and mudslides which hits Bosnia and Herzegovina in May 2014.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - One of the most important application areas of signal processing (SP) is, without a doubt, the software-defined radio (SDR) field [1]-[3]. Although their introduction dates back to the 1980s, SDRs are now becoming the dominant technology in radio communications, thanks to the dramatic development of SP-optimized programmable hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and digital signal processors (DSPs). Today, the computational throughput of these devices is such that sophisticated SP tasks can be efficiently handled, so that both the baseband and intermediate frequency (IF) sections of current communication systems are usually implemented, according to the SDR paradigm, by the FPGA's reconfigurable circuitry (e.g., [4]-[6]), or by the software running on DSPs.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Monitoring of photovoltaic (PV) systems can maintain efficient operations. However, extensive monitoring of large quantities of data can be a cumbersome process. The present work introduces a simple, inexpensive, yet effective data monitoring strategy for detecting faults and determining lost revenues automatically. This was achieved through the deployment of Raspberry Pi (RPI) device at a PV system's combiner box. The RPI was programmed to collect PV data through Modbus communications, and store the data locally in a MySQL database. Then, using a Gaussian Process Regression algorithm the RPI device was able to accurately estimate string level current, voltage, and power values. The device could also detect system faults using a Support Vector Novelty Detection algorithm. Finally, the RPI was programmed to output the potential lost revenue caused by the abnormal condition. The system analytics information was then displayed on a user interface. The interface could be accessed by operations personal to direct maintenance activity so that critical issues can be solved quickly.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Remote education in engineering has been proven to be difficult in some practical areas. However, these practical areas and, more specifically, labs are high valuable for students and very important to help them grasp their theoretical knowledge. In the electronics field labs are crucial to understand every concept, and these labs should not be only simulation-based labs but real ones. Following this course of action, VISIR has been demonstrated its ability to accomplish with this task, however some limitations appear when building some circuits and, of course, not every case is covered. A proof of concept of an FPAA based-lab controlled and supported by a Raspberry Pi will be developed in this conference paper analyzing its benefits and possible synergies with other projects and labs with the objective of accessing to the potential and features of the FPAA in remote engineering education.  2019 IEEE.

It introduces the hardware and software features of the BeagleBone Black. It then presents the learning outcomes, contents and lab organization. The comparison of the BBB with another commonly used single board computer Raspberry Pi is also discussed. Two developed Internet of Things (IoT) relevant capstone projects are reported. Our experiences demonstrate that BBB is an easy-to-use development board which can be employed by college-level students for developing complex embedded computing systems, especially targeting at network applications.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - The original aim when creating the Raspberry Pi was to encourage "kids"-pre-university learners-to engage with programming, and to develop an interest in and understanding of programming and computer science concepts. The method to achieve this was to give them their own, low cost computer that they could use to program on, as a replacement for a family PC that often did not allow this option. With the original release, the Raspberry Pi included two programming environments in the standard distribution software: Scratch and IDLE, a Python environment. In this paper, we describe two programming environments that we developed and recently ported and optimised for the Raspberry Pi, Greenfoot and BlueJ, both using the Java programming language. Greenfoot and BlueJ are both now included in the Raspberry Pi standard software distribution, and they differ in many respects from IDLE; they are more graphical, more interactive, more engaging, and illustrate concepts of object orientation more clearly. Thus, they have the potential to support the original aim of the Raspberry Pi by creating a deeper engagement with programming. This paper describes these two environments and how they may be used, and discusses their differences and relationships to the two previously available systems.  2016 by the author.

N2  - Many introductory computer-programming classes in engineering fields stress coding skills, but they often do not incorporate data acquisition or output until later classes. Interfacing computers with laboratory equipment is an excellent way to engage and excite students who may not otherwise see the importance of programming. Additionally, they collect and process data directly instead of receiving artificially or simulated data. Our laboratory curriculum integrates the Raspberry Pi, an inexpensive and versatile single-board computer, with a standard computer to provide dynamic and engaging biomedical-engineering-related programming activities in an introductory MATLAB course, all without complicated MATLAB commands or routines. The total cost for each station is only about 75 or less. Concurrently, more complicated engineering concepts are introduced at this early level to pique interest in biomedical engineering and improve learning in later classes when these concepts are described in more detail. Students report enjoying programming more and seeing its quintessential role in engineering experiments while being better prepared for later computer-based courses and job opportunities.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a new computing paradigm that may soon add a new dimension to the skillset expected from a well-rounded computing professional. Computer Science education is addressing these demands by adding IoT-centric courses to the curriculum and including relevant content into a broad range of existing courses. This paper presents the experience of incorporating IoT projects into an existing Systems Programming course. We examine several suitable hardware platforms, provide a sampling of student projects implemented using the Raspberry Pi with a variety of sensors, and discuss a number of lessons learned that could benefit other educators planning to incorporate the IoT material into their coursework.  2017 ACM.

N2  - In the present paper we discuss some ideas about the evolution of "Hardware  Software reconfigurable" and from the teaching point of view to correlate these ideas with the new developments connected with the new compiler from LabVIEW to Raspberry PI. This new development helps the university teachers to better introduce students to the concepts of new reconfigurable devices based on LabVIEW and using powerful and low price devices like Arduino and/or Raspberry PI 3 Model B. This methodology helps our students to develop their skills in Graphical Programming Language (LabVIEW) at the same time that also efficiently develop educational and industrial applications.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi is a small computer useful for teaching students basic computer knowledge. This paper discusses the integration of the Raspberry Pi in an introductory information systems course. Previously, the initial course in the College of Engineering and Information Sciences was a general applications course not focused on computer science or engineering. A new course was developed integrating the raspberry pi with hands on labs to improve student engagement. The initial course should be exciting and motivating to students. By creating a new course with interesting labs that integrate the Raspberry Pi, higher pass rates and student satisfaction will be achieved.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Learning about sensor technology and actuator early is important as a step towards knowing and introducing of advanced technologies based on Internet of Things (IoT). The difficulties are how to learn sensor technology and move the actuator with accessing General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) of Raspberry Pi 3 Platforms using programming language syntax which often confusing and difficult to understand. To help people learning IoT by using Raspberry Pi 3 with an interesting Android apps, we believe that this learning module can integrate about the ease and attractiveness of IoT System Editor based on Android apps. This research create a mobile programming apps based on Android which people can build IoT project easily with GUI without program and middleware based on Raspberry Pi to connect between apps and hardware with especially task to manage data communication, data flow, and device driver. Hopefully new developer can develop the IoT application easily by using Android mobile visual programming that combined with Raspberry Pi 3 platform.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Academia has always sought to ride the line between established thought and new developments. No much more so than in the terms of technology. Universities seek to teach using known and proven methods and resources but also stay relevant with new technologies to provide students the knowledge they will need to be competitive in the work place or graduate field. In this work we will present how the University of Nevada approaches this problem with its Real Time Operating system course. Namely on how using the established Micro C/OS II Real time Operating System with the new builder phenomena the Raspberry Pi we can overcome the challenge of updating a tried and true lesson plan in order to use technology relevant and interesting to the students of today.

N2  - Onboard transit systems are commonly used for commutes to and from home, work and other destinations. However, this is generally not productive time with commuters often gazing out of the window. Other systems have proposed a solution to this problem however, they are offline and would require each device on each vehicle to be updated manually. In this paper, we present an onboard educational Wi-Fi system that offers educational content which can be updated remotely as well as free internet access to particular commuters. Also, specific users can be allowed to browse the internet by connecting wirelessly while onboard. Additionally, Edu-Bus can be used as an educational tool, requiring persons to watch an educational video or read some educational content before gaining access to Edu-Bus services such as free Wi-Fi. Our system uses a Raspberry Pi which is converted into a wireless hotspot, as well as an optional USB or Wi-Fi modem to connect to the 3G/4G provider. Additionally, Edu-Bus can be powered directly from an adapter using the vehicles cigarette lighter outlet or temporarily from its internal battery. We implemented this work on-board a fleet of four (4) buses at the University of The West Indies Cave Hill Campus. We analyzed student connections to the system generated by user activities. Our approach to this problem not only makes Edu-Bus extendable but also introduces the ability to deploy similar systems on varying vehicle types and modes of transportation.  2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

N2  - A compelling robotics course begins with a compelling robot. We introduce a new low-cost aerial educational platform, the PiDrone, along with an associated college-level introductory robotics course. In a series of projects, students incrementally build, program, and test their own drones to create an autonomous aircraft capable of using a downward facing RGB camera and infrared distance sensor to visually localize and maintain position. The PiDrone runs Python and the Robotics Operating System (ROS) framework on an onboard Raspberry Pi, providing an accessible and inexpensive platform for introducing students to robotics. Students can use any web and SSH capable computer as a base station and programming platform. The projects and supplementary homeworks introduce PID control, state estimation, and high-level planning, giving students the opportunity to exercise their new skills in an exciting long-term project.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, an intruder detection system has been built with an implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) using raspberry pi, Microsoft's Azure and Twilio cloud systems. The CNN algorithm which is stored in the cloud is implemented to basically classify input data as either intruder or user. By using the raspberry pi as the middleware and raspberry pi camera for image acquisition, efficient execution of the learning and classification operations are performed using higher resources that cloud computing offers. The cloud system is also programmed to alert designated users via multimedia messaging services (MMS) when intruders or users are detected. Furthermore, our work has demonstrated that, though convolutional neural network could impose high computing demands on a processor, the input data could be obtained with low-cost modules and middleware which are of low processing power while subjecting the actual learning algorithm execution to the cloud system.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - This educational project uses a second generation Raspberry Pi that runs multiple Open Source software packages, to perform network penetration testing and to analyze the results. Implementing this project provides undergraduate students with practical hands-on experience and explains advanced concepts in computer hardware, operating systems, and network security. This project is fairly affordable, highly portable, easily deployable, alarmingly impactful, and highly rewarding. It also demonstrates the need for secure wireless networks against various attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM). This paper illustrates step-by-step instructions to assemble and integrate the project's hardware parts, to download and configure software packages, and to perform customized network operations such as packet sniffing and filtering. Kali Linux for Raspberry Pi is the chosen operating system due to its extensive and powerful collection of White Hat hacking tools such as Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer), Nmap (Network Mapper), and SSLstrip (Secure Sockets Layer strip). Additional wireless network auditing tools are used from the robust FruityWifi package. Wireshark filters, captures, and analyzes network packets, such as hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) requests. SSLstrip strips the secure connection and convert HTTPS to hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), gaining access to sensitive information such as login credentials. This simple to implement yet powerful project, demonstrates the ease of hiding and discreetly deploying a Raspberry Pi on a vulnerable wireless network to sniff network packets that is considered protected behind firewalls, while maintaining a safe distance and anonymity from the target.

N2  - (work in progress). In 2012, Ebon Upton started the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which introduced the Raspberry Pi (RPi) as a $35 basic computer. The goal was to reignite public interest in programming and increase enrollment in college computer science. Today, the third RPi iteration features a multicore processor, a small GPU for display graphics, WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity. Surprisingly, even though the RPi has become very popular with the public and college students for do-it-yourself projects and maker culture, instructors have not widely used it to teach operating systems concepts. In this paper, I share my experience using the RPi in my Operating Systems class. The paper makes the following contributions:  Pedagogical advantages of using the RPi over other traditional and cloud-based methods to teach operating systems concepts  Challenges for the instructor and students running many RPis in a classroom setting over the campus enterprise network.  Advantages of using the RPi to stimulate student creativity and motivate them to design and implement their own related computing projects.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The light field is a 4D function that represents the radiance of light traveling in every direction through every point in 3D space. In this paper, we demonstrate how effectively 4D light fields can be sampled from the real world using a custom-built 4D light field camera system constructed based on cheaply and commonly available Raspberry Pi computers. The camera system consisting of a camera array and a dedicated calibration software is flexible and scalable in structure because the system can be reconfigured easily to meet the users needs. We show the effectiveness of the camera system by interactively visualizing captured 4D light fields using our GPU-accelerated light field renderer supporting a virtual camera model that synthesizes various photographic effects including zooming and panning, refocusing, focus breathing, and depth-of-field control. We believe that the do-it-yourself 4D light field camera will be explored effectively in traditional application fields, such as computer graphics and vision, and in other areas like science education.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Similar to a fingerprint search system, face recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects or finding missing persons. Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect's face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer's uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in accurate detection of faces compared to state-of-the-art face detection and recognition methods, and verify its effectiveness for enhancing law-enforcement services in smart cities.  2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - For different purposes, a service robot that can be controlled remotely will play a significant role in the expansion of robotics automation systems. In the developing countries like Bangladesh, everyone is concerned about safety from both natural and human-made situations like Disposal of Bombs, rescuing objects from dangerous places, a useful assistant for handicapped people. In this paper, we propose to make a Robotic Car (RC) which helps to enter an environment of higher risks, grab and move to an appropriate place. For developing this generic model, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ is used as the central control unit for the robot. Six Degree of Freedom (DOF) Arm is used to compute as the main factor for grabbing the objects. Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter is the remote handheld controller for the RC. Also, a raspberry pi 0.6MP camera is integrated for live video streaming. The live streaming will provide the actual scenario of the environment to operate, control and navigate the RC. This robot also carries some important sensors like Gas sensor, Ultrasonic Sonar Sensor and 3-Axis Digital Compass to bring out the scientific task of the robot. This prototype can be both used for educational and research purpose. The performance of the robot can be measured by the transmission of the video streaming, control system success rate for RF controller, outcomes of the sensors and the accuracy of the 6 DOF Arm.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is made up of many devices, platforms, and communication protocols. Among them, Raspberry Pi has arisen as one of the most popular equipment for hobby and education purposes because of its low cost, small size, flexibility, and potential. Nevertheless, Raspberry Pi needs an operating system to work, which exposes it to software vulnerabilities despite the many advantages it provides in comparison with nonoperating system devices. This device also has hardware limitations, which impact on its security. These limitations exist because some concessions had to be done during the design in order to decrease the cost of the device. This article analyzes different hardware and software vulnerabilities that can be found in a Raspberry Pi when using a default installation of different available operating systems. Finally, we propose a list of good practices to minimize the presented issues.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - Our paper describes a challenging and enjoyable undergraduate student project that details the process of configuring a Raspberry Pi into an advanced multimedia player as a headless system controllable by infrared remote or secure shell (SSH) protocol. This paper provides a methodological, step-by-step set of specific instructions on how to replicate this project. The undergraduate student applied concepts from operating systems (OS), networks, and electronics into practical steps to exploit readily available open-source software packages and highly-customizable hardware components. Electronic components were soldered to build a modified printed circuit board (PCB) with a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen and push-buttons, and were successfully combined with an external sound card, wireless universal serial bus (USB) card, and an infrared (IR) receiver into a fully assembled, affordable, and reliable device. This developed device can be controlled using any IR-capable remote, is capable of playing high-quality audio, and circumvents advertisements on the free audio streaming web service Pandora Radio using a pre-existing free or paid account. Using this device improves the user's experience of Pandora Radio in several ways while keeping this device portable and preserving all functionality of the Raspberry Pi itself. The goal of this project is to use available tools and integrate various technological fields into a deliverable consumer product. Consumer electronics continue to place increasing emphasis on supporting open-source hardware and software, and the Raspberry Pi provides an affordable, flexible, multi-purpose platform for both beginners and experts to personalize into a wide range of useful and specialized products.

N2  - This paper presents a new approach to develop remote practices for Systems Engineering and Automatic Control laboratories based on Easy JavaScript Simulations (EJsS), Raspberry Pi and Node.js. EJsS is used to create a JavaScript and HTML5 laboratory front-end that lets teachers and students parametrize and observe the behavior of the controllers/systems under study from the web-browsers of their tablets and smartphones. The Raspberry Pi, a low-cost single-board computer, is in charge of running 1) the C program that closes the control loop over the selected plant and 2) the JavaScript laboratory web server that hosts the laboratory front-end and communicates it with the controller. Finally, the JavaScript development and runtime platform Node.js is used 1) to develop and run the Javascript laboratory web sever within the Raspberry Pi and 2) to support the communications between the laboratory front-end and server. The new strategy, tested over a Proportional/Integral/Differential (PID) controller for a vertical mono-rotor plant, provides low-cost real-time support to the controller and friendly remote access from mobile devices to the practices for the students.  2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Facial expression recognition is an active research area for which the research community has presented a number of approaches due to its diverse applicability in different real-world situations such as real-time suspicious activity recognition for smart security, monitoring, marketing, and group sentiment analysis. However, developing a robust application with high accuracy is still a challenging task mainly due to the inherent problems related to human emotions, lack of sufficient data, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel, cost-effective, and energy-efficient framework designed for suspicious activity recognition based on facial expression analysis for smart security in law-enforcement services. The Raspberry Pi camera captures the video stream and detects faces using the Viola Jones algorithm. The face region is pre-processed using Gabor filter and median filter prior to feature extraction. Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) features are then extracted and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained, which predicts the known emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise). Based on the collective emotions of the faces, we predict the sentiment behind the scene. Using this approach, we predict if a certain situation is hostile and can prevent it prior to its occurrence. The system is tested on three publically available datasets: Cohen Kande (CK+), MMI, and JAFEE. A detailed comparative analysis based on SURF, SIFT, and ORB is also presented. Experimental results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system in accurate recognition of suspicious activity compared to state-of-the-art methods and validate its superiority for enhancing security in law enforcement services.  2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - In today's fast paced world where everything is changing so quickly with technology, our education system' model still remains the same. Especially when it comes to the quality of practical learning in Computer Science and Engineering courses, even e-Learning lacks far behind. In order to bridge the gap between what students are made to study in textbooks and what actually runs inside the computer system, we have taken one of the most important area of Computer Science and Engineering i.e. CPU scheduling policies in operating systems. Till now we have just taught students about the working behavior of scheduling policies either diagrammatically or through simulation, but here we are presenting the real-time implementation of scheduling policies by creating various kernels for different types of operating systems which run first-in, first-out (FIFO) or round-robin (RR) respectively. This helps students to understand and appreciate the behavior of these scheduling policies in a real-time environment and to analyze various parameters practically. The analyzed behavior makes students understand about the advantages and drawbacks of each policy practically on a real-time system. This research work also helps students in realizing that the behavior of a particular scheduling policy is not same for all types of systems. It varies when we change the type of processors and processes in an operating system. Each policy has a different behavior on different system and not exactly same as what they study in textbooks.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents an application of the Raspberry Pi for detecting laser spot using the OpenCV library. To capture the image, a Web-Camera connected to the USB port of the Raspberry Pi is employed. Since the Raspberry Pi is small in size, the module could be mounted on the gun for laser shooting. Compared to the existing laser shooting, our method has benefit in the flexibility of laser shooting mechanism, where the shooter could move the gun freely without the restriction of the camera's cable connection. The image processing tasks and interfacing to the camera could be accomplished by the Raspberry Pi mounted on the gun. Experimental results show that the proposed system could detect the laser spots under the varying backgrounds, lighting conditions, and shooting distances effectively. The processing speed of 18 fps could be achieved for real time implementation.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - The resulting of advanced technology, the size of Personal Computer (PC) was reduced into the same size as cigarette box. Thus, the Brinell-macro-hardness tester used Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3) Model B to acted as the Data Acquisition System (DAS) or the mini-PC which used for measuring of Active-Weight-Loading (AWL) parameters. This DAS used the triplex of force-resistive sensors equipped using IC-MCP3008 and interfaced with RPi3. This IC was used to converse the analogue signal of AWL to 10 bits of the digital signal, and then, the digitalized-data were transferred through the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) of RPi3, respectively. In the acquisition procedure, the real-time of measuring-data were revealed using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) which developed using the python language version 2.7. Consequently, it was perceived that this DAS can be fabricated using simple and low-cost design. Therefore, this contrivance can be regularly used for AWL measurement which is the one part of Brinell hardness measurement. Finally, the fabrication of electronic parts and software interfacing which manipulated using RPi3 were presented in the discussion section.  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - The Houston Toad is an endangered amphibian living in the edge of extinction. To save from annihilation, localization of their mating call needs to be detected in order to protect the eggs from being hunted by predators. The current method of monitoring their vocalization lacks real-time and onboard voice recognition property. In this paper, a solar powered battery connected to a Raspberry Pi is designed with a microphone that records environmental sound at prescribed intervals triggered by a Witty Pi module. The purpose for developing such prototype is to deploy a trained neural network predictor model to identify Houston Toad onboard, and if it exists, send notification of time stamp and location via email and SMS over the GSM and GPRS modules to the researcher.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Telepresence robots in static pan-tilt form can be a viable and affordable choice for tele-education. However, cost considerations may impose limitations on usability and expected performance. The goal of this study was to explore the usability of a low-cost, static pan-tilt telepresence robot operated using an Android smartphone. Experiments were carried out with 26 participants from two age groups (14 students M = 20 years, 12 staff M = 25 years) in a laboratory. Each participant interacted with the robot to perform two tasks. The opinions of the participants preand post-experiments, and the time they took to complete the tasks, were recorded. The results show that the average latency (of 3.1  0.8 s for one robot movement) is quite acceptable. The students were faster than the staff when controlling the robot remotely but slower when working at the robot site. Correlation analysis shows that confidence in the robot and the likelihood of adoption is strongly related to data privacy features. All the methods used to control the robot remotely show positive interaction to each other. This implies that the majority of participants were focussed on the control methods and data privacy provided in the robot platform, and were willing to accept a small delay in robot movement.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) is being used more and more nowadays. While this makes our lives much easier, offering modern solutions like smart homes or cars, it also brings new security issues in this area: sensors and other similar IoT devices with scarce resources and functionality have limited ways of providing appropriate security, and every day there is an increasing number of malicious users taking advantage of this. As providing per-device protection is difficult or even impossible, a much better solution would be to do this in centralized manner, from the network router all local IoT devices are connected to. In this paper we propose a router-level IoT security method using a Raspberry Pi configured as a network router. We describe the necessary steps to conFigure the proposed security infrastructure, some possible attacks (e.g. SQL-injection, DoS, brute-force attacks) and defense strategies we developed against them.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Space weather research is an important aspect in studying and monitoring the effects of extraterrestrial forces outside the earth on human activities. Stanford University under International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI) program has developed first generation of sudden ionospheric detection named as SuperSID. To enable the usage of this system for community outreach space science education program, a portable and low cost system need to be developed. Raspberry Pi can be used as the main processor for the SID system. It can be easily operated without the need of a personal computer. However, the available sound card are limited and sampling rate is on 48 kHz. This limit the detection of the VLF frequency detection to approximately 22 kHz. Thus it become a limiting factor to view the VLF spectrum in a full range (3-30 kHz). To overcome this problem, a VLF receiver system with a better sound card (Audio Injector) was proposed to detect the signal in a full VLF spectrum with the objective for a better data analysis. The hardware aspects including an antenna, a preamplifier, a sound card (Audio Injector) and a microprocessor (Raspberry Pi) with LCD Touchscreen as its monitor display. The VLF acquisition software part consists of an acquisition software executable by Python programming language with additional modules that runs in Raspberry Pi. Finally a portable VLF receiver system with maximum sampling rate of 96 kHz has been developed to capture VLF signal between 3-30 kHz.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Sensor networks are a highly researched application area in the field of Internet of Things (IoT). A key cost and resource question in the development of IoT network sensor solutions is prototype implementation. In this study, the Raspberry Pi-a widely used single board computer-is investigated as it is one of the most commonly used prototyping devices available and is also widely used in scientific research. In this paper, we address which technologies, the usefulness and what kinds of issues arise when the prototyping of a sensor network solution is done with Raspberry Pi. The extant literature is studied by selecting papers with the systematic literature review method. Based on an extensive survey of the selected studies, we found several sensor-based implementations where Raspberry Pi has been used. In addition, this survey revealed subjects, such as e-health and education, which expanded the research topic in new ways. Further research opportunities have been identified in specifying the usefulness of various technologies with single board computers.  2017 Croatian Society MIPRO.

N2  - The miniature Raspberry Pi computer has become of interest to many researchers as a platform for building sociotechnical IoT systems for end-users; however, for the end-user to design and build such apps themselves requires new people-oriented tools and design methods. This chapter describes a people-oriented design method called TANDEM and demonstrates the use of it in detail, by way of a case study- the design of a mashup of services and local data stores-that solves the so-called movie-cinema problem. An implementation of the newly designed movie-cinema app is then built within the DigitalFriend, an end-user programmer IDE. Furthermore, a significant part of the TANDEM design method is then automated within the development tool itself. This automation removes the most skilled task required by TANDEM of the end-user: The automation of the process of data normalization. The automation applies data normalization to the initial model of components and data sources that feed into the mashup. The presentation here relies on some understanding of data normalization, so a simple example is presented. After this demonstrated example of the method and the implementation, the authors discuss the applicability of a model achievable by end-users using TANDEM coupled with the automated normalization process built into the IDE vs. using a top-down model by an experienced information analyst. In conclusion, the TANDEM method combined with the automation as demonstrated does empower an end-user to a significant degree in achieving a workable mashup of distributed services and local data stores and feeds. Such a powerful combination of methods and tools will help the Raspberry Pi to become a significant people-oriented platform, beyond just a platformfor teaching novices to code. Furthermore, the TANDEM method does have broader applicability to designing a broad class of logic programs, complementing the use of collected patterns in logic programs.  2018 by IGI Global.

N2  - Modern memory hierarchies are complex pieces of hardware, combining memory controllers, caches, and memory-management units in a desperate attempt to keep modern high-speed processors fed with data. Recent developments, including the introduction of nonvolatile memory, further complicate the situation. Operating systems are highly tuned to current memory systems; modifying them to take advantage of new developments is a difficult process. The low-level code involved is complex and hard to follow. This makes teaching students about modern memory systems a struggle, as wading through the complicated code in a full operating system like Linux can be frustrating. To this end we develop vmwOS, a simple operating system designed for low-cost Raspberry Pi development boards. Although inexpensive, these widely used boards support most of the features of modern memory systems, including 64-bit addresses, multi-level caches, multi-core, and full ARMv8 processor and MMU support. vmwOS is simple enough that students can follow the code and make modifications for memory hierarchy exploration. We describe a number of memory research topics that can be explored with this infrastructure, including a detailed examination of simulating non-volatile RAM support.  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The electrochemical sensor exploits current or voltage on the electrodes when the chemical reaction occurs between the sensitive part of the electrode and the heavy metal ion detected. The output of current or voltage changes corresponds to the amount of ion concentration of heavy metal in water. This research aims to develop signal processing system using raspberry PI as a supporting electronic scheme of electrochemical sensor to detect and analize heavy metal pollutant. The system contains of potentiostat, signal conditioning and data acquisition schemes. This research covers the activities of the design and development of Raspberry Pi based supporting electronic scheme, PCB and the electronic components, as well as the software program for the measurement of signal input from the electrochemical sensor. The performance of K500 system developed in the research is a little bit lower than that of the system published by another researcher. Despite its performance, this system costs only $45 cheaper than previous system that costs $100. For full version, i.e. including Raspberry Pi as a server, the K500 system with the dimension of 110x90x70 mm costs only $70, cheaper than the other system using laptop computer as a server that costs $60 without its server.

N2  - The demand for more efficient and environmentally benign, non-conventional sources of energy came into picture due to increasing demands for human comforts. Solar energy is now the ultimate option. In this paper, the instruments used to measure the solar radiation at Innovation Centre, MIT Manipal were connected to a Raspberry Pi to access the data remotely. Genetic Algorithms were formulated, so that the monthly mean global solar radiation in Manipal can be effectively estimated. Meteorological data such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, etc. were used as inputs to train the networks. A successful network was made between the data loggers and the Raspberry Pi. The data collected by the data loggers from the devices are transmitted to the Raspberry Pi which in turn sends the data to an internal server. The Raspberry Pi can be accessed using any SSH client such as PuTTY. The meteorological data was collected for the years 2010-2014 in order to formulate the Artificial Intelligence models. The validity of the formulated models were checked by comparing the measured data with the estimated data using tools such as RMSE, correlation coefficient, etc. The modelling of solar radiation using GA was carried out in GeneXpro tools version 5.0.  2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

N2  - A talking pen is the evolutional way of learning especially for children because it is fun and interactive. Commercial talking pen use a small infrared camera to capture the hidden dot patterns that hidden around a book's page. Specific sounds are generated according to the location of the pen on the pages. This image processing for recognition technique is complex and need calculation power because it had to calculate relative location and orientation of dots in a group. Although, the talking pen is successful product but it is not flexible to add new pattern or uses different set of patterns. In this research, the new approach for hidden dot pattern recognition is proposed. Convolutional neural networks or CNNs is selected as the recognition software. The system is built on Raspberry Pi Zero W hardware with Raspbian operating system and TensorFlow platform. MobileNet is used in the research since it small and effective for limited resources platform. MobileNet is trained by using the infrared images that captured by infrared camera module that connected to Raspberry Pi. Result shows that the accuracy of the proposed method is good enough and the response is fast enough to be implemented into the real-time commercial product and has ability to expand to any other kind of patterns without limit because the learned network can be updated easily without alter recognition software.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Small credit-card-sized single-board computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, are becoming ever more popular in areas unrelated to the education of children, for which they were originally intended. So far, these computers have mainly been used in small-scale projects focusing very often on hardware aspects. We want to take single-board computer architectures a step further by showing how to deploy part of an orchestration platform (OpenStack Swift) on a Raspberry Pi cluster to make it a useful platform for more sophisticated data collection and analysis applications located at the edge of a cloud. Our results illustrate that this is indeed possible, but that there are still shortcomings in terms of performance. Nevertheless, with the next generation of small single-board computers that have been introduced recently, we believe that this is a viable approach for certain application domains, such as private clouds or edge computing in harsh environments.

N2  - Wireless sensor network applications in the agricultural sector are gaining popularity with the advancement of the Internet of Things technology. Predominantly, wireless sensor networks are used in agriculture to sense the important agricultural field parameters, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture level, nitrite content in the soil, groundwater quality, and so on. These sensed parameters will be sent to a remote station, where it will be processed and analyzed to build a decision support system. This paper describes the implementation of a wireless visual sensor network for precision agriculture to monitor paddy crop for weeds using Raspberry Pi. Bluetooth 4.0 was used by visual sensor nodes to send the data to the base station. Base station forwarded the data to the remote station using IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n standard. The solar cell battery was used to power up the sensor nodes and the base station. At the remote station, images were preprocessed to remove soil background and different shape features were extracted. Random forest and support vector machine classifiers were used to classify the paddy crop and weed based on the shape features. The results and observations obtained from the experimental setup of the system in a small paddy field are also reported. This system could be expected to enhance the crop production by giving timely advice to the crop producers about the presence of weeds so that steps can be taken to eradicate weeds.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - Middleware is a software layer located between software (operating system) and hardware (physical). This layer is flexible, where middleware can be built with a variety of features for many functions or even spesific tasks. Typically, middleware used in distributed system for software development. In this paper, the middleware created using Python parallel programming language and will be planted on Raspberry Pi 3. To help people learning IoT for basic, we create console apps for send and receiving command line data to access sensor or actuator. This middleware serves to translate a line of commands used to run or access the various features contained in IoT module. For the time efficiency of program function execution, multiprocessing or multithreading is used in Python. The multiprocessing or multithreading used in Python is expected to create middleware with distributed process for more efficient processor, to provide heterogeneity access of sensor or actuator, more simply hardware interfacing and to enhance collaboration between application and hardware. At the last, we compare multiprocessing and multithreading for CPU bond and memory usage.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, it is aimed to implement object detection and recognition algorithms for a robotic arm platform. With these algorithms, the objects that are desired to be grasped by the gripper of the robotic arm are recognized and located. In the experimental setup that established, OWI-535 robotic arm with 4 DOF and a gripper, which is similar to the robotic arms used in the industry, is preferred. Local feature-based algorithms such as SIFT, SURF, FAST, and ORB are used on the images which are captured via the camera to detect and recognize the target object to be grasped by the gripper of the robotic arm. These algorithms are implemented in the software for object recognition and localization, which is written in C++ programming language using OpenCV library and the software runs on the Raspberry Pi embedded Linux platform. In the experimental studies, the performance of the features which are extracted with the SIFT, SURF, FAST, and ORB algorithms are compared. This study, which is first implemented with OWI-535 robotic arm, shows that the local feature-based algorithms are suitable for education and industrial applications.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - The convenience for most people is to have the ability to control or view details of surveillance made by a robotic system even when they are not at home. In this paper, we design an efficient robot that is capable of video surveillance even at night. The method consists of a web based wireless controlled night vision surveillance robot using Shell script with raspberry pi. The web page has video screen for surveillance and buttons to control robot and camera. For proper surveillance at night, a night vision camera has been implemented. The web page is the command control center for the robot, which can be run in both computer and mobile phone (IOS/Android). The signal, which is generated from web page, are sent to Raspberry pi through Wi-Fi and Raspberry pi receives these signals according to Shell Script written in Raspberry pi. Therefore, the commands are processed and the robot is directed with user directive. The Video Streaming is done using MJPG streamer program that gets MJPEG data and the movement of the robot is controlled by Shell Script which sends it through a HTTP session.
