**Description:** These are the supplementary materials and dataset for the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on SBCs in engineering and computer science education. 

**Purpose:** This study aims to analyze how the SBCs are employed in engineering and computer science education and what educational outcomes are derived from their usage during the period 2010-2020.

The review followed the PRISMA(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideliness available at [http://www.prisma-statement.org/](http://www.prisma-statement.org/) 

## Files and Folder description

- The folder .RIS(Dataset) contains the .RIS files for the different stages in the review. In the files "Engineering_VillageRIS1-6" are the totality of the identified studies in the review which have been retrieved through the Elsevier tool (Engineering Village). Likewise, the files "SynthesisGroup" and "QualitativeSynthesis" include the selected studies for the stage one (overall analysis-n=155) and for the stage two (qualitative synthesis-n=16) in the SLR. These files are ready to be incorporated in Mendeley. 

- *NVIVO*: This folder contains the coding files for the emerged categories in the stage of qualitative synthesis. 

- *Figures*: In this folder are located the figures for the SLR. 

- *Python Scripts*: It contains the designed algorithms to extract the information of the Crossref API.
