	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The Raspberry Pi is a single board computer (SBC) priced at 35 USD – less than the cost of many textbooks. The current model (3B) includes a quad-core ARM 64-bit CPU, 1 GB of RAM, a 2-core GPU, and numerous communication ports, including USB, HDMI, Ethernet, WiFi and Bluetooth. This combination of low cost and high functionality creates many new pedagogical possibilities for CS educators, ranging from using the Raspberry Pi to teach assembly language to using it as a multiprocessor. Relatedly, mathematics educators have produced an extensive literature on the use of pedagogical tools known as “manipulatives” that have been shown to be effective at starting students through a “concrete, representational, abstract” progression of understanding of an abstract topic (e.g., [1-5, 7]). In this approach, students interact with a manipulative that provides a “concrete” representation of a mathematical abstraction; subsequent pedagogy using representations of the abstraction (usually pictures) help the student start building a mental model of the abstraction; further pedagogy using a symbolic representation helps the student extend their mental model and progress to a more nuanced understanding of the abstraction. The basic idea dates back to Papert, who called manipulatives “objects-to-think-with” [6]. Subsequent research has shown this approach to be effective at improving student mastery of a wide variety of mathematical abstractions, ranging from algebra [2], to fractions and ratios [4], to computation and problem-solving [1,3]. Other researchers have noted that manipulatives can make learning enjoyable and fun [5]. We believe this same “concrete, representational, abstract” progression can be used to help students master many CS topics that are often taught as abstractions. More precisely, the Raspberry Pi can be used as a manipulative to provide students with a concrete representation of specific CS topics ranging from CPUs to primary vs. secondary storage to distributed multiprocessors; topics that would – in the absence of a concrete representation – remain fuzzy abstractions to students. By providing a “concrete” foundation on which to build, a SBC like the Raspberry Pi (R-Pi) can provide the first step in helping students build mental models of such abstractions, and thus enhance student learning. Like [5], our experience also suggests that many students find the R-Pi to be a fun and enjoyable way to learn about these abstractions.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The recent development of the Raspberry Pi mini computer has provided new opportunities to enhance tools for education. The low cost means that it could be a viable option to develop solutions for education sectors in developing countries. This study describes the design, development and manufacture of a prototype solution for educational use within schools in Uganda whilst considering the social implications of implementing such solutions. This study aims to show the potential for providing an educational tool capable of teaching science, engineering and computing in the developing world. During the design and manufacture of the prototype, software and hardware were developed as well as testing performed to define the performance and limitation of the technology. This study showed that it is possible to develop a viable modular based computer systems for educational and teaching purposes. In addition to science, engineering and computing; this study considers the socioeconomic implications of introducing the EPi within developing countries. From a sociological perspective, it is shown that the success of EPi is dependant on understanding the social context, therefore a next phase implementation strategy is proposed. textcopyright 2013 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Computer education is in the midst of a major transformation as a result of the rapid emergence of new technologies, intersection of computing with other disciplines and growing interest among students in computing courses. Such transformation prompted educators to redefine the way computing education is delivered and experiment a wide range of learning approaches. One of these approaches is the integration of hardware prototyping platforms such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Intel Internet of Things as part of project-based learning. These platforms have become in recent years instrumental tools for improving students' learning process and promoting proactive thinking. The aim of this study is to investigate the usefulness of integrating low cost open-source hardware platforms into engineering and computer science courses. In particular, we explore the use of an experiential learning approach using these kits for improving the students' learning experience in computer science and engineering courses. Throughout this paper, we discuss the outcome of our investigation and provide insights on how to make classrooms more experiential using the hardware prototyping paradigm.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper proposes a methodology for learning of languages programming using open hardware tools. It has chosen as study case, the teaching of Python language due to versatility, structure and robustness that this language provides in the design and construction of hardware and software elements in devices such as Arduino or Raspberry PI. However, this methodology can be employed in the teaching of other type of programming languages such as C, Java, or Dart. It has selected as educational framework of the methodology some sections of the model known as Stage Self Direct Learning (SSDL) which provides a conceptual base that serves as reference model allowing to build a methodology in which the students will be participant of their own educational process. In order to enhance the learning process in the students, in the structure of course, it has designed an e-learning course taking as platform to ILIAS (Integriertes Lern-, Informations- und Arbeitskooperations- System). It is an open source platform with some features such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) resources, forums, surveys, taxonomy services, exercises and assessment. During the development of course, different kinds of resources were created and shared through this platform, these were subject to discussion providing a space for the exchange of ideas and experiences associated with the main topics of this course. The methodology established allowed to encourage the interest of the students in the learning and use of programming languages as likewise using them in the design of projects that require the use of open hardware resources.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper describes the ideas of using Raspberry Pi computers in high schools and higher education. Raspberry Pi is a powerful computer in a size of a credit card. It was created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation charity, whose primary goal was the re-introduction of computer skills learning among students. The Raspbian operating system is based on Linux and offers an excellent working environment for students, as it includes software solutions designed to expand students' knowledge of computer science in an interesting way. Besides computer science knowledge, it is also suitable for acquiring basic knowledge in electronics. It is also very important to have the possibility of interconnecting such acquired knowledge. Our students have adopted the knowledge how to install and use the Raspbian operating system, how to network and connect to the Internet, how to write programs using the Python programming language, and how to develop hardware-based projects. From our own experience in Raspberry Pi we can conclude that this is an ideal platform for students to acquire new knowledge and competences in the field of computer science and electronics.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: As computer platforms become more advanced, the need to teach advanced computing concepts grows accordingly. This paper addresses one such need by presenting XinuPi3, a port of the lightweight instructional operating system Embedded Xinu to the Raspberry Pi 3. The Raspberry Pi 3 improves upon previous generations of inexpensive, credit card-sized computers by including a quad-core, ARM-based processor, opening the door for educators to demonstrate essential aspects of modern computing like inter-core communication and genuine concurrency. Embedded Xinu has proven to be an effective teaching tool for demonstrating low-level concepts on single-core platforms, and it is currently used to teach a range of systems courses at multiple universities. As of this writing, no other bare metal educational operating system supports multicore computing. XinuPi3 provides a suitable learning environment for beginners on genuinely concurrent hardware. This paper provides an overview of the key features of the XinuPi3 system, as well as the novel embedded system education experiences it makes possible.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Background: Teaching bioinformatics at universities is complicated by typical computer classroom settings. As well as running software locally and online, students should gain experience of systems administration. For a future career in biology or bioinformatics, the installation of software is a useful skill. We propose that this may be taught by running the course on GNU/Linux running on inexpensive Raspberry Pi computer hardware, for which students may be granted full administrator access.Results: We release 4273, an operating system image for Raspberry Pi based on Raspbian Linux. This includes minor customisations for classroom use and includes our Open Access bioinformatics course, 4273 Bioinformatics for Biologists. This is based on the final-year undergraduate module BL4273, run on Raspberry Pi computers at the University of St Andrews, Semester 1, academic year 2012-2013.Conclusions: 4273 is a means to teach bioinformatics, including systems administration tasks, to undergraduates at low cost. 2013 Barker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.</td>

In particular we explain how we structure laboratory exercises to reflect the typical industrial design practice of partitioning systems into application layer and presentation layer - utilising QNXTM RTOS for application, integrated with open-source Qt for presentation and human interaction. The target application is based on a simple automotive dashboard executing on the Beagleboard-xM platform.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The Learning Enhanced Watershed Assessment System (LEWAS) lab is a high-frequency, realtime environmental monitoring lab located on the campus of Virginia Tech. This lab has developed over the course of 9 years from a prototype system used in one class to a real-time environmental monitoring system that has been in used in 21courses across 6 institutions and in 3 countries. Throughout its development, this lab has also hosted an NSF/REU site at Virginia Tech for 8 years. Every year for 10 weeks during the summer 8-11 students, coming from several universities and having various disciplinary backgrounds, join the site. Among them, 1-2 engage in interdisciplinary research work in the LEWAS lab, while others join different research labs across the Virginia Tech campus. As of 2015, 12 REU fellows have been mentored by the faculty advisors and the graduate students (including four authors of this paper) of this lab. In this paper, we will discuss the work of these 12 REU fellows and how their combined contribution aided the development of the present LEWAS lab. In 2007, the first REU student to join the lab developed a simple prototype for a wireless data collection system, aiming to design an on-campus watershed sciences and engineering laboratory. This prototype iteratively evolved with the help of other REU students to the present LEWAS, which has the following four stages: 1) data inputs that consist of environmental instruments including an acoustic Doppler current profiler, a water quality sonde and a weather station each taking measurements every 1-3 min., 2) data processing occurring locally on a Raspberry Pi, 3) data storage on a remote server and 4) data visualization through an Online Watershed Learning System (OWLS) (www.lewas.centers.vt.edu/dataviewer) through which end users access the LEWAS data for research and education. Each REU fellow significantly contributed to the development/maintenance/application of two or more of these stages. The implementation of all four stages was a complex process that required interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, which were obtained not only through graduate mentors representing different disciplines (engineering education, civil &amp; environmental engineering, electrical &amp; computer engineering, computer science and environmental science) but also REU students who were pursuing a range of undergraduate degrees (civil &amp; environmental engineering, computer science, computer engineering, chemical engineering and environmental science). Through research experiences in an interdisciplinary lab, REU fellows were exposed to a wide spectrum of learning and research work, beyond their disciplinary domain. The authors, in turn gained experience mentoring the REU fellows in their research work. The knowledge shared in this paper demonstrates how an interdisciplinary engineering system/lab can be iteratively built as a result of undergraduate research work under graduate mentorship. This study also shows how an REU program can support the development of an engineering lab as well as the research of several masters and PhD students.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Telemedicine and Telehealth are disciplines dedicated to provide health care and health care education when distance is an issue. Nowadays, Telemedicine and Telehealth Stations (TTSs) are used to provide physicians and educators with tools that concentrate and integrate different technologies, contributing to organize and simplify their workload. To support scenarios involving features related to teleconsultation and tele-education, TTSs must consider the adoption of hardware platforms robust enough to reach minimal requirements while providing service deliverability and continuity. Despite being usually built for execution on desktops and laptops, it is possible that TTSs be reorganized to use Single-Board Computers (SBCs) as a most portable-and cost-effective solution. Aiming to evaluate such possibility, this work presents a performance study of four of the most popular SBCs available on the market, focusing the execution of web conferences in the context of the Santa Catarina State Integrated Telemedicine and Telehealth System (STT/SC), in Brazil. Using descriptive statistics, we concluded that the Raspberry Pi 2 SBC is the best option to be adopted, considering its results regarding CPU consumption, memory utilization, and video delay.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a new approach to develop remote practices for Systems Engineering and Automatic Control laboratories based on Easy JavaScript Simulations (EJsS), Raspberry Pi and Node.js. EJsS is used to create a JavaScript and HTML5 laboratory front-end that lets teachers and students parametrize and observe the behavior of the controllers/systems under study from the web-browsers of their tablets and smartphones. The Raspberry Pi, a low-cost single-board computer, is in charge of running 1) the C program that closes the control loop over the selected plant and 2) the JavaScript laboratory web server that hosts the laboratory front-end and communicates it with the controller. Finally, the JavaScript development and runtime platform Node.js is used 1) to develop and run the Javascript laboratory web sever within the Raspberry Pi and 2) to support the communications between the laboratory front-end and server. The new strategy, tested over a Proportional/Integral/Differential (PID) controller for a vertical mono-rotor plant, provides low-cost real-time support to the controller and friendly remote access from mobile devices to the practices for the students.</td>

The program is coupled with a C library of key robotics functions, together with working example codes and educational materials, making it exceptionally easy to get started, and to extend. Volume 1 of the program targets embedded control robotics education at the "maker" level, and is easily accessible in high schools and beyond. Building directly on Volume 1, Volume 2 of the program targets the "professional" level, building on knowledge of ODEs, dynamics, control theory, and op amps, and is useful in senior-level college capstone courses industry. Prototype versions of BeagleMiP were used by the authors during the last three offerings of UCSDs fall-quarter senior-level Embedded Control Robotics course. The electronics used have evolved from an Arduino Nano and various small development boards, assembled on an 830-point solderless breadboard, to the powerful &dollar;50 BBB paired with our highly extensible robotics cape, which incorporates the commonly-needed additional electronics for many robotics applications, including an IMU, barometer, battery management, H-bridges, real-time clock with battery backup, and over a dozen convenient connectors, into a very small footprint. The best-practices programming techniques fostered by this program implement an advanced software architecture written in C, with different threads running at different loop rates and priorities. The resulting educational program will be commercially available soon, marketed in partnership with WowWee Robotics. 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: For different purposes, a service robot that can be controlled remotely will play a significant role in the expansion of robotics automation systems. In the developing countries like Bangladesh, everyone is concerned about safety from both natural and human-made situations like Disposal of Bombs, rescuing objects from dangerous places, a useful assistant for handicapped people. In this paper, we propose to make a Robotic Car (RC) which helps to enter an environment of higher risks, grab and move to an appropriate place. For developing this generic model, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ is used as the central control unit for the robot. Six Degree of Freedom (DOF) Arm is used to compute as the main factor for grabbing the objects. Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter is the remote handheld controller for the RC. Also, a raspberry pi 0.6MP camera is integrated for live video streaming. The live streaming will provide the actual scenario of the environment to operate, control and navigate the RC. This robot also carries some important sensors like Gas sensor, Ultrasonic Sonar Sensor and 3-Axis Digital Compass to bring out the scientific task of the robot. This prototype can be both used for educational and research purpose. The performance of the robot can be measured by the transmission of the video streaming, control system success rate for RF controller, outcomes of the sensors and the accuracy of the 6 DOF Arm.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Nowadays using multimedia applications is common in classroom teaching. As we know that use of chalk produces dust which pollutes air and also it is found that chalk dust causes hazardous effects on health of students and parents. In the other hand, use of multimedia helps in better teaching and learning process. Companies like Hitachi, Panasonic, are manufacturing smart equipments which can efficiently replace the traditional blackboard. This design includes two modules viz. ARM9 board processor for unit which will be controlled by user i.e. teacher called handheld Unit hardware and Embedded Linux operating system for its software. Another module is remote unit which consist of Raspberry-Pi ARM 11 Board. Teacher has to write on a notebook sized touch screen which is interfaced with ARM9 handheld unit board. Written signals are converted into electrical signals and given to ARM11 board by using wireless RF module (Zigbee). Then Arm11 board controls and processes these signals and displays the written contents by the projector in large view by interfacing projector to HDMI port provided with Raspberry-Pi. This complete module makes classroom teaching more efficient and easy for the sake of students and teachers.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We present our approach to teaching functional programming to First Year Computer Science students at Middlesex University through projects in robotics. A holistic approach is taken to the curriculum, emphasising the connections between different subject areas. A key part of the students' learning is through practical projects that draw upon and integrate the taught material. To support these, we developed the Middlesex Robotic plaTfOrm (MIRTO), an open-source platform built using Raspberry Pi, Arduino, HUB-ee wheels and running Racket (a LISP dialect). In this paper we present the motivations for our choices and explain how a number of concepts of functional programming may be employed when programming robotic applications. We present some students' work with robotics projects: we consider the use of robotics projects to have been a success, both for their value in reinforcing students' understanding of programming concepts and for their value in motivating the students.</td>

The PiDrone runs Python and the Robotics Operating System (ROS) framework on an onboard Raspberry Pi, providing an accessible and inexpensive platform for introducing students to robotics. Students can use any web and SSH capable computer as a base station and programming platform.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive computing system that can play an essential part of any computing curriculum. Since its release in 2012, the Raspberry Pi has been infiltrating K-12 education; it has the potential to make coding in K-12 schools as commonplace as textbooks. It has also changed the playing field for hobbyists by offering a low-priced general-purpose computing system that challenges the Arduino in terms of open source support. In this paper, we advocate using the Raspberry Pi (RPi) throughout the University computing curricula as well. Low-priced and portable, the RPi is an exposed hardware platform students can tinker with without fear of breaking. Properly used, it affords students the opportunity to experimentally discover many aspects of computing. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of the RPi that make it appropriate for a University computing curriculum. We describe our classroom experiences and laboratory best practices as well as survey the work of others involved in integrated the RPi into University curriculums.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a Computer Aided Control System Design (CACSD) environment completely based on the programming language Python. Students can perform all the control design tasks (modeling, identification, controller design, simulation) in this environment, and at the end, they can automatically generate RT code for targets like a PC or a Raspberry PI with a Linux RT OS. A Python package for control purposes have been developed at the Caltech by Richard Murray, with the aim of integrating the most used functions and methods available in other commercial and non commercial software. Using this package it is possible to design different kinds of controllers for laboratory plants (PID, state-feedback, LQR, including full and reduced order observers). An additional package developed at SUPSI allows representing the full system in a graphical block diagram, similar to xCos or Simulink, and automatically generating code for RT targets. This application offers the most used blocks required for the design of a control system. New blocks can be easily integrated into this SW. This environment has been validated at the SUPSI laboratory on different electromechanical plants: the classical Inverted Pendulum, the Disks and Spring system, the Ball on Plate and the Ball on Wheel plants.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: As computer architecture integrates multiple concepts such as microarchitecture, design, the hardware-software interface, compilers, and operating systems, there is an always increasing need to develop new methods for learning and exploring the field. Parallelism in computer systems is a key focus in computer architecture and some core parallel concepts include Amdahl's law, efficiency, and overhead. While there are a number of ways to examine these topics in traditional lectures and assignments, a unique way is to leverage Python-based programming environments that allow students to independently explore concepts and their governing parameters. This paper presents the highlights of PyCompArch Python module developed using the IPython Notebook environment to help the study of concepts in computer architecture. Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language, but traditionally the language does not play a leading role in the education of computer architecture. IPython Notebooks allow developers to interactively run Python code cells and to construct Python codes that execute on remote servers that eliminate any system requirements of the individual. In this way, the environment supports web-based remote "in the cloud" code development that can be modified during lectures or in homework assignments. The PyCompArch module supports a number of ways to help individuals learn concepts of parallelism related to computer architecture as well as explore experiments in computer performance and control. For example, PyCompArch supports the evaluation of performance of real-world benchmarks such as Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) and dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) in Raspberry Pi systems. Overall, the PyCompArch supports student learning and development of experiments in computer architecture.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we report on our "Iridis-Pi" cluster, which consists of 64 Raspberry Pi Model B nodes each equipped with a 700 MHz ARM processor, 256 Mbit of RAM and a 16 GiB SD card for local storage. The cluster has a number of advantages which are not shared with conventional data-centre based cluster, including its low total power consumption, easy portability due to its small size and weight, affordability, and passive, ambient cooling. We propose that these attributes make Iridis-Pi ideally suited to educational applications, where it provides a low-cost starting point to inspire and enable students to understand and apply high-performance computing and data handling to tackle complex engineering and scientific challenges. We present the results of benchmarking both the computational power and network performance of the "Iridis-Pi." We also argue that such systems should be considered in some additional specialist application areas where these unique attributes may prove advantageous. We believe that the choice of an ARM CPU foreshadows a trend towards the increasing adoption of low-power, non-PC-compatible architectures in high performance clusters.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The study of robotics is often an excellent recruitment motivation for students entering a computing curriculum. It is also often cited that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related robotics is a critical area of future innovation in computing. However, there are a number of challenges to implementing a robotic curriculum at the university level. A few of those challenges include, lack of a uniform hardware platform, incongruity in the software used, and the missing significant deliverable artifacts by students at the end of a term to encourage learning and further interest. Educational robotic activities are often treated as advanced research topics with high associated costs that prohibit widespread integration into the curriculum. In this paper, we present the deployment of a multi-stage robotic platform that attempts to address these challenges and overcome the obstacles. We detail the evolution of the hardware from using a readily available LEGO Mindstorm base platform to next include the addition of an Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Likewise, we detail the transition from the basic LEGO Mindstorm software to the use of leJOS and PYTHON. At each stage, additional sensors and software libraries can likewise be added. Finally, we present an achievable academic goal for students to use the hardware and software platforms to develop a model autonomous vehicle with aspects of intelligent control, learning and adaptive behaviour. All levels of projects can be undertaken at the appropriate level of maturity for the students in the computing curriculum.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Small computer board platforms, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and micro: bit are very common, cheap, and useful tools to teach modern technology, coding, and experimenting in different disciplines at various levels. Due to the huge available information on websites, it is very easy to find a solution for almost any job and problem, therefore one may not be motivated to work out an own version, to study carefully, to understand the principles in-depth and to be creative. Thris is also one of the reasons why so high proportion of the examples employ technically inadequate methods, misleading concepts. These are rathe serious problems concerning high-quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Although technology and available tools change rapidly, the basic principles remain the same, therefore education should focus on a better understanding of these. On the other hand, it is very important for the future's engineers, developers, and professionals to follow the correct methods, to be reliable, creative, and open to the more and more common interdisciplinary methodology. In this paper, we demonstrate this approach by investigating exciting interdisciplinary phonocardiography and photoplethysmography experiments and related electronics, data acquisition, and signal processing. In our work, we focus on the understanding and applying the correct methods, provide a detailed analysis of common pitfalls and leave room also for additional work. Students and teachers, lecturers can learn what to consider, pick what they find useful for their projects. It is also important to note, that the principles are valid for much other instrumentation and information processing jobs as well. 2013 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A nomadic laboratory or testbed, based on Raspberry Pi 3 computers and Arduino microcontrollers, has been developed in order to teach subjects related to computer architecture. The testbed can be transported to the classroom. Students can access it through the available network, which can be a wireless LAN, wired LAN o a custom network. Students can access without constraints to the platforms, therefore there are a wide range of possible experiments. This laboratory was used during 2017 for practical works in the course Introduction to Technology, and during 2018 in two courses of Computers Architecture at Universidad Nacional of Cuyo and in a course of Wireless Networks at Universidad de Mendoza. Some of the experiments that are been carried out by students are: to explore and analyse the architecture of computers through Linux commands, write and run programs on different programing languages, input and output operations through memory mapped addressing and isolated addressing, write interrupt service routines in order to service interrupts, multithreading programing, explore memory maps, CPU features, etc. This paper describes the testbed architecture, experiments performed by students in the mentioned subjects, present the students feedback, and describes the possible methods in order to integrate it to a remote laboratory.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are highly multidisciplinary systems that involve disciplines such as embedded computing, control theory and communication technology. Even though building this kind of systems is a challenging task, its introduction during the last courses of computer science and engineering university degrees has proven very valuable to teach students to deal with complexity. This paper presents an educational experience in the field of Computer Science at the University College of Engineering of Vitoria-Gasteiz (UPV/EHU). As part of an elective course, students had to design and develop an Android-based remote control system for teleoperating an educative mobile robot controlled by means of a Raspberry Pi. They had to apply and combine concepts learnt in previous disciplines (such as programming, operating systems or communication networks), reinforcing already acquired skills, as well as gaining other generic skills demanded in their future professional career, such as: (1) effectively working in groups, (2) integrating different technologies, (3) proactive problem solving, or (4) coping with system complexity.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The online experimentation is in expansion in Higher Education Institutions, with a dynamic extension to all scientific areas. The integration of online labs in higher educational courses constitutes a significant financial saving way for the institutions with multiple benefits for student's learning. Without access and usage time restrictions, these labs provide a wide range of experiments, performed individually or in groups, repeated as often as needed, without any space or time restrictions, just imposing the Internet access is available and in good conditions. This paper describes a use case application of a web platform that integrates, monitors and controls different technologies, such as Wireless Sensor Networks, Virtual Sensor Networks and Data Acquisition Boards, through an Internet accessible RESTful API, using low-cost devices such as the Raspberry Pi. In this context, a remote laboratory is developed for students programming in Python, based on such platform to improve their programming skills, overcome their difficulties in CS1 and CS2 courses, and give the ability to interact to physical world through practical examples.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: By design, the computer science curriculum for undergraduate students in the United States does not include enough hands-on courses such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. It is difficult for students, especially the Distance Learners (DL) to appreciate the power of computer science as a problem-solving field without real-world experiments. Furthermore, students in computer science may drop-out or turn away from the field because it does not offer an opportunity for them to communicate with each other during online/traditional labs. In this paper, an active learning project-based approach in online/traditional computer science courses is introduced to make the courses' material more attractive to students from minorities. Students obtain a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world problems. Students will enjoy the challenges they face when developing solutions. This paper studies the impact of hands-on project-based learning using Raspberry Pi on students taking online and face-To-face computer science courses at Old Dominion University. 2019 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The rapid development of e-learning and towards Massive Online Open Course requires the diversity of learning media as content. One type of learning media is interesting and easy to understand is multimedia learning media, especially video. In providing video content, an e-learning system requires high hardware and network availability resources. It certainly requires a lot of investment cost and resources. This research proposes solutions to these problems by designing and implementing multimedia servers with a simple network infrastructure that can provide video content and other multimedia-based learning media. Multimedia servers are created using single board microcomputer called Raspberry Pi that has a function as servers, and multimedia content will be accessed using smartphone devices by users. The advantages of this infrastructure are 1) Low cost but high performance approaching conventional servers; 2) Flexible and can be accessed via mobile using a smartphone. The result after performance measurement showed that CPU usage is approximately 10&#37; from 1.2 GHz, the memory usage approximately 518 Mb out of 998 Mb, the network latency is still below threshold delay from TIPHON standardization, the video quality is still on the mini HD although accessed by 50 users, and the temperature is still in the normal levels.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents an adaptive framework (web application) that supports secure, end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT) sensing architecture, which includes loosely coupled set of components with well-defined interfaces that can be adapted to a wide range of uses. Moreover, the framework was adopted in a Computer Science (CS) Fog computing course to get formal evaluation by undergraduate students. IoT has emerged as a new network paradigm, involving connecting physical world through sensors (temperature, humidity, intensity, etc.) to the Internet, to provide opportunities for building intelligent systems and applications. There are a few notable characteristics of today's IoT systems that serve as impediments for greater adoption. First, the common, well-documented platform that spans end-to-end, and which can cover a multitude of practical uses, is still missing. The second impediment is the lack of standard energy-efficient platform. Third, with the growing deployment of IoT devices, the attack vector for possible exploitation increases, which dictates an increase in the ongoing cost to ensure Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability triad. In this project, we propose the solution to address these impediments. The proposed framework makes it economical and easy to adapt to (e.g. to learn and to support). The next benefit comes with the use of environment harvesting equipment (solar cell, in-line hydro-generators, thermoelectric cells, etc.) and use of energy efficient coding methods, including security and communication provisions. Overall, the project successfully integrates Amazon Cloud technologies, Raspberry-Pi and Arduino embedded systems using energy-harvesting technologies, secure communication using government standards, and highly available network of nodes using wireless technology into a Cloud-of-Things (CoF).The methodology allows a myriad IoT devices connected to the Internet to be easily monitored and manipulated through the implemented web application. On the other hand, since few dedicated IoT courses are currently offered, most Science, technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students will have limited or no exposure to IoT development until after graduation, and inadequately prepared in IoT development to enter into the workforce. Therefore, the implemented framework was introduced in a CS special topic course to get comments and formal evaluations from undergraduate STEM students. An outline of a well-developed courseware is presented in the paper. The courseware is evaluated through survey questions. The majority of the students provided positive feedback and enjoyed the IoT framework.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper aims to propose a short course with a commercial off the shelf unmanned aerial vehicle (COTS UAV) system. From the short course, students can have a conception of a UAV system, and they would have not only the knowledge about the hardware integration but also the theoretical background of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) and the situation awareness system. The proposed course consists of two parts; the GNC system for holding the position and the situation awareness system with the marker detection and tracking. A Pixhawk is selected for a flight controller with an open source autopilot, i.e. px 4, and a Raspberry Pi with a downward camera is utilised for the visual navigation of the situation awareness system. The Pixhawk and Raspberry Pi are integrated into the robot operating system (ROS) via the WIFI network, and the MAVROS is adopted for the communication between the Pixhawk and the Raspberry Pi. The first part of the course is designed as the hands-on based lectures, and the second part of the course is adopted the problem-based project.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Purpose: For several decades, calligraphy has been popular among people in Japan, China, and even in the world. Traditionally, a teacher teaches how to write letters on a paper with a brush, and a student will imitate them by referring to the model letters. However, if a teacher is not available, this method will not be applicable either. This study aims to propose a calligraphy learning assistant system (CLAS) using projection mapping, which allows a student to learn calligraphy by him/herself. Design/methodology/approach: By following the letter writing video of a teacher that is directly projected on the paper, a student is able to learn the stroke order and writing speed in addition to the letter shape. Moreover, the letter portion practice function is incorporated in CLAS to allow a learner to repeat practicing hard portions of each letter. Findings: For evaluations, the authors implemented CLAS using Raspberry Pi and open-source software and asked students to use it. The results confirmed that CLAS is effective in improving calligraphy skills of novice students. Originality/value: With CLAS, a student can practice calligraphy using a conventional brush, ink and paper at a desk while looking at the model letter writing of a teacher projected on the paper using projection mapping. 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper describes some results of the FP7 CLEM project, Cloud E-learning for Mechatronics. An interesting development has been the creation of remote laboratories in the cloud. Learners can access such laboratories to help with their practical learning about mechatronics without need to set up laboratories at their own institutions. On the other hand the cloud infrastructure enables multiple laboratories to come together virtually to create an ecosystem for educators and learners. From such a system, educators can pick and mix materials to create suitable courses for their students. This means that learners can experience different types of devices and laboratories through the cloud. The paper provides an overview of the CLEM project, presenting results so far. In addition to the remote laboratories set up using a Raspberry Pi and Arduino microprocessor structure, this paper also presents information on the results of a survey and the development of static learning material. It also explains how a holistic e-learning experience can be obtained through use of static and dynamic material together with facilities for collaboration and innovation. textcopyright 2013 IEEE.</td>

It combines a set of software and hardware resources in the interest of offering a multidisciplinary low-cost open platform for engineering education. Thus, the proposed approach allows students to develop low-cost and easily programmable prototypes of electrical systems control, robotics, and other embedded devices that feature Internet connectivity, Input/output, networking, and operating systems. In the proposed work, the authors present a codesign solution with flexible hardware devices, providing characteristics of multipurpose use with many experimental devices, and fully configurable graphical user interface. The physical setup and communication principles of hardware architecture are based on two types of devices: the Beaglebone running embedded Linux operating system and the field-programmable logic gate array. The graphical user interface is designed as a web page based on HTML and PHP programming languages; this allows the teachers/students to control the system easily, parameterize, and observe the behavior of the controller/system remotely.

The characteristics of developed simulators for MATLAB/Simulink including their limitations, and the idea of a cross-platform simulator independent of specific hardware or software are presented. Mathematical models of selected nuclear reactor's processes with special emphasis on the durations of their transient states and the desired step in the simulation are characterized. Architecture of the simulator, code development and its implementations on different hardware platforms (PC and Raspberry PI) and on different operating systems (Windows, Linux, Raspbian) are presented. Studies were performed to obtain the minimum possible simulation steps while maintaining regime operation in real-time on each platform. Comparison of compliances with the reference simulator and assessment of suitability of the various versions of simulators to educational and research tasks were carried out.

The results shown contain answers of about 60 students, both evening and regular. In general, students appreciate the use of pocket labs due to the flexibility in time and the possibility to repeat exercises for a better understanding. There appeared a small difference between the results relating to evening and regular students; evening students, which a generally limited in time, prefer the flexible time management when using pocket labs, and regular students, which usually have less technical background, prefer the easier understanding of the content.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents our experience implementing a newly designed introduction to computing course for first year undergraduate students. The redesigned course focuses on the use of Raspberry Pi microcomputers as a common computing platform in order to encourage student experimentation and fun in a relatively low-cost environment. The course we describe represents a departure at our university from a traditional first-semester introduction to computing which emphasized foundational technical and mathematical skills but less exploration of the field of computing in a more wholistic manner. Our new course focuses on exposure to computing through experimentation. Additionally, it emphasizes community building among the students as well as affording them the opportunity to bring their creativity to bear in a final project showcase. As a result, the course is proving to be attractive not just to traditional computing majors but to a wider swath of the university community. This paper describes the topics selected in the redesign of the course, a summary of the labs involved, a discussion of assignments, and a description of the final project process. We discuss feedback received from students and the overall perception of the course among students and faculty. We also reflect on our experiences from redesigning the course and provide advice for those wishing to adopt a similar introductory course.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper is on free and open source software architecture (FOSS) for remote labs in order to address the affordability and scalability of robotic education technology for sustainable deployments. The proposed Raspberry Pi-Arduino-based model architecture ensures lower cost while allowing some scalability, interoperability, portability and interchangeability to the low-cost online laboratory. Remotely controlled lab provides training skills in bio-inspired robotics. Our previous studies had shown that the implementation of remotely controlled online labs in the curriculum improved active learning among students, collaboration, and augmented problem solving skills. The preliminary implementation involved proprietary software, as the remote experiment accessibility platform, which was later replaced with FOSS technology. The advantages with FOSS included a significantly lower cost and scalability for concurrent usage. The paper also reports on usage analysis and common issues in both cases of implementations.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: During the last years many virtual laboratories have been developed, but not all of them were successfully adopted. Designing, planning and creating a virtual laboratory can be a very difficult process, which can get even more complicated if the laboratory has to provide access to real equipment. One of the most problematic steps when developing such virtual laboratories is the selection of the right access method. At the present moment of time there are many technologies that allow users to access devices remotely. One of these possible solutions is to use the Telnet/SSH protocols for remote access. Nevertheless, the use of these protocols require at least one active network interface per device, which in some cases can present a problem. There are some other drawbacks of using Telnet/SSH for remote access as well - virtual laboratories are often created with the purpose to be used in the education process, which means that the users of these systems in most cases are students. These less experienced users might accidently delete the configuration of the interface that is dedicated for the remote access, which will result in the immediate loss of connection to the device and will require administrator intervention to fix this access issue. An alternative solution to provide remote access is to use a console server. A detailed analysis on the possibilities for remote access using console servers, present them as reliable, but also as a very expensive solutions. In this paper we will investigate the possibilities to replace the expensive console servers with much cheaper devices. One such device is the Raspberry Pi - a low cost device that was developed to enhance the education process of children and students in the field of the computer sciences and their related subjects. In this paper we will investigate and compare the characteristics of the Raspberry Pi to the most widely used console servers and we will present a way to use the Raspberry Pi as a console server for remote access to telecommunication routers and switches.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The 2013 ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines highlight the importance of teaching parallel computing to undergraduates in higher education. Universities have responded to this need, but there remains a hole in most curricula. While techniques for parallelizing code and using tools such as MPI and OpenMP seem to be well covered, concepts of shared versus distributed memory and race conditions are often taught only at an abstracted level. Using the educational operating system Embedded Xinu, students can write ARM assembly code that makes use of instructions meant specifically for multicore interaction. By having students implement exercises such as the coupon collector's problem, they can gain a much deeper understanding of potential issues with sharing memory and maintaining cache coherence. This added curriculum fits with existing computer organization courses and helps to prepare students for future work in parallel computing. This paper presents specific enhancements used with the Embedded Xinu operating system and its associated ARM Playground, as well as a pilot study using the new curriculum with undergraduates in a typical hardware systems course.</td>

While certainly introducing important concepts, desktop based computing instruction misses a huge and vitally important aspect of computation, namely microprocessor based embedded systems. In this paper, we propose to replace desktop based instruction with a cheap, small, portable computing platform: the Raspberry Pi (RP). RP offers the best of both worlds and at the same time, offers the student to develop complete (and interesting) computing projects. Additionally, we discuss the ramifications on IT infrastructure and IT support resulting from incorporating RP into the computer science curriculum.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents the idea about how to combine a set of software and hardware resources available in literature to be used as support to control engineering education. The available tools allow to mix topics related to programming, communications, operating systems, and control theory. The well-known Raspberry Pi board is used as platform to exploit the different proposed concepts. SciPy, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries, which are Python-based open-source libraries for scientific computing and graphical representation, are used to perform Matlab-like simulations and to implement classical control loops. On the other hand, virtual processes developed in Easy Java Simulations are adapted to be controlled through the network from a controller implemented on the Raspberry Pi with Python. This option is very useful from a teaching point of view since time-based, networked-based, or event-based control approaches can be easily introduced on this proposed architecture. Furthermore, once students know how to implement control loops on the Raspberry Pi using Python, external real processes can be easily controlled by using the GPIO interface available in the this electronic board. Then, a project based on these tools and ideas is motivated and presented in this paper to control a two-tank level process c Copyright IFAC 2015.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper documents the augmentation of Raspberry PI (plus its camera module) to a typical VEX robot, yielding a mobile robot with onboard image processing capability. The VEX robot denotes a robot constructed using the VEX robotic kit, which is controlled and programmed by the Cortex microprocessor that comes with the kit. Though the Cortex microprocessor is powerful enough for motion control and processing sensors such as integrated encoder, sonar range sensor, and touch sensor, the current VEX robotic kit does not provide a true vision sensor that allows real-time image processing. To enhance the functionality of the VEX robot, a Raspberry PI (with its camera module) is introduced to the robotic system, where the PI will be dedicated for image processing. Information extracted from the video sequence are then sent via UART port to the Cortex, which controls the basic motion of the robot. Detailed procedures to construct the vision-enhanced VEX robot is described. The resulting robotic system with the Raspberry PI and Cortex combination greatly expands the usage and application domain of the robot, making it suitable for more complex and advanced tasks such as vision-based control, visual servoing, and visual tracking. This paper also provides a sample lesson plan that consists of basic motion in 2D (controlling the mobile base only), trajectory generation in 3D (controlling a robotic arm on top of the mobile base), and examples of advanced topics (e.g., vision-based control). We believe these projects will significantly improve an existing robotics curriculum, enhance students' hand-on skills, and lead to more challenging undergraduate projects.</td>

However, these practical areas and, more specifically, labs are high valuable for students and very important to help them grasp their theoretical knowledge. In the electronics field labs are crucial to understand every concept, and these labs should not be only simulation-based labs but real ones. Following this course of action, VISIR has been demonstrated its ability to accomplish with this task, however some limitations appear when building some circuits and, of course, not every case is covered. A proof of concept of an FPAA based-lab controlled and supported by a Raspberry Pi will be developed in this conference paper analyzing its benefits and possible synergies with other projects and labs with the objective of accessing to the potential and features of the FPAA in remote engineering education. 2019 IEEE.</td>

To arouse the interest and learning initiative of students, we propose them to build a setup including a Raspberry Pi and image processing programmes. This inexpensive single board computer answers todays issues in energy saving and permits to review fundamental hardware and software principles. Secondly, we propose a low-cost setup for a time-limited practical work: a Raspberry Pi is shared and controlled remotely by several student pairs: we emphasize the interest of collaborative work, and we provide knowledge and skills about micro-computers to a large number of students simultaneously.

The main difficulty in using these embedded devices is that the device must be physically connected to a regular computer in order to be programmed to do useful work.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Due to the opportunities provided by the Internet, people are taking advantage of e-learning courses and enormous research efforts have been dedicated to the development of e-learning systems. So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we present an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We carried out some experiments with a student of our laboratory for gamma type of brain waves. We used MindWave Mobile (MWM) to get the data and considered four situations: sleeping, relaxing, active and moving. Then, we used mean-shift clustering algorithm to cluster the data. The evaluation results show that our testbed can judge the human situation by using delta, theta, gamma and alpha brain waves. 2018 IEEE.</td>

In this paper, we discuss the use of the Raspberry Pi single-board computer (SBC) to provide students with hands-on multicore learning experiences. We discuss how the authors use the Raspberry Pi to teach parallel computing, and present assessment results that indicate such devices are effective at achieving CS2013 PDC learning outcomes, as well as motivating further study of parallelism. We believe our results are of significant interest to CS educators looking to integrate parallelism in their classrooms, and support the use of other SBCs for teaching parallel computing. 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a course project assignment in an upper-division engineering course: Controls and Optimizations. Students were divided into groups to build robots which are capable of navigating autonomously indoors. It is a perfect vehicle to integrate electrical, computer, and mechanical knowledge into a mechatronics system. In particular, after the mechanical and electrical design were finished, the students wrote control software to use feedback from ultrasonic sensors and Wi-Fi modules to enable autonomous operation. Each powered by a Raspberry Pi, the robots competed against each other autonomously to play an indoor Bocce game. The jack of the game was a wireless router, and the goal of the robots was to get as close to the jack as possible while not hitting any obstacles. This project and the Bocce game also have practical implications in real-world applications. For example, robots with similar capabilities may be able to rescue people who carry wireless device, to navigate in factories or warehouses to retrieve items, and to lead customers to certain items in supermarkets. In this paper, we will present the electrical, mechanical, and software design of the winning team of the Bocce game. The bill of materials and details of the Bocce game will also be included. On the educational front, we discuss a couple of efforts we made to help the students build, program, and test the robots: (i) we design an introductory LAB to introduce Raspberry Pi to our students and (ii) we utilize project-based learning techniques to encourage the students to learn new things along the way.

The use of remote experiment can aid in this learning process reducing difficulties and shortcomings related to the lack experimentation and interaction with phenomenonthat occur in traditional classes. This paper reports on the use of a remote experiment used for students learning about material elastic properties (Hook's Law). The experiment in this paper is composed of: a helical spring coupled to a didactic press, a Raspberry Pi controller, a local server and a Website for accessing educational content and controlling the experiment. The learning environment also allows access through mobile devices. During the experiment, charts and parameter tables are displayed on the screen. These data are sourceof informationfor students calculating and analyzing the phenomenon observed, relating theory to practice. 2013 IEEE.</td>

This article will show a new remote experiment called Educational Compression Testing Machine teleoperated via Internet. This experiment will create the possibility for the students to do a real compression test and to collect force applied in the specimen and size data during the experimentation process. These data will be useful for the construction of flow curve of metals aiming the calculation for projects of formed parts. The remote experiment is divided in two basic parts: the website and the Educational Compression Testing Machine. For data acquisition, control and data processing, as well as the interface between the user and the machine was used the Raspberry Pi that is a small size and low cost microcomputer. The reduced structure for the experiment and the low cost were defined as priority for this work, aiming to fit the necessity of undeveloped countries. 2015 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The explosion of multimedia applications within embedded devices has ensured that Image Processing and Machine Vision has now become a mainstream subject within most Computer Science and Electronic Engineering curricula. Yet often there exists a disconnection between the rapid prototyping tools that are taught within the laboratory to demonstrate concepts and those that are used for actual deployment in a stand-alone product. This calls for an approach whereby students are exposed to multiple levels of abstraction, in order to align the skill sets of our students with the requirements and expectations of industry. This paper describes the development of a senior level undergraduate course that introduces machine vision and image processing algorithms and implementation topics within the larger context of embedded computing. The key focus is that the student appreciates the theoretical concepts but is also capable of implementing them on embedded processors for prototyping or production. 2014 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: "Handwritten characters" are a means of communication with deafblind person. "Handwritten characters" are written by caregivers with fingers on the palm of a deafblind person. "Handwritten characters" have the feature of being easy to learn because a person can recognize hiragana and katakana intuitively. Many deafblind person can communicate using this method. However, because the caregiver must stay by the persons side, it imposes a heavy burden. For this study, we developed a support device that is able to recreate handwritten characters remotely without the assistance of a caregiver. The system consists of a mobile terminal on the input side, a server, and an output device. On the input side, characters are input using a mobile terminal on which a dedicated application is mounted. Applications are supported by Windows OS (Microsoft Corp.) and Android OS (Alphabet Inc.). Users have two modes of inputting characters: keyboard input and writing characters directly one by one. For keyboard input, a user can send more than one character at a time. The server uses Raspberry Pi. When the server receives character data via the network, it transmits character coordinates to the output device based on the data. In addition, a character file that records the coordinates of the character is stored in advance. When writing characters directly, the received data are converted to a format that can be read out by the output device. Then the data are transmitted to the output device. For keyboard input, the sent character strings are decomposed one character at a time. For the decomposed characters, the coordinate data are read out from the character file corresponding to each character and are transmitted to the output device. The output device performs a process of reproducing the handwritten character to the deafblind person. We used software (Makeblock mDrawBot; Makeblock Co., Ltd.) embedded in the device, which performs character output using coordinate data. This output device, which operates based on the coordinate data transmitted from the server, is connected to the server via a wire. Makeblock mDrawbot is plotter software that draws based on X and Y coordinates. We are studying the mechanism of adding Z coordinates so that it can be drawn according to the hand position. Development of this device demonstrated that the input characters were output correctly. Additionally, it reduces the labor of writing directly. This device can reduce burdens on caregivers. 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The objective of this 'work-in-progress' paper is to describe a Raspberry Pi based learning center management system that assists in deciding resource allocation for a peer-instruction driven engineering tutoring center. Data gathered from the usage of the engineering tutoring center allows for cost-effective staffing through recognition of the center's usage trends. The data collected may be structured per the center administrator's requirements and presented real-time on dashboards. The flexibility of this Raspberry Pi system allows for it to be developed into a full fledged learning management system with integrated analytics as required for a particular curriculum. This system is highly cost-effective as compared a commercial web-based system. This prototype has saved approximately 12 hours a month of time, for data retrieval and analysis as compared to a previously used commercial web-based system. At the moment, this Raspberry Pi data tracking system has been installed only in a single tutoring center on-campus. Deployment of this across a university campus would allow accumulated usage trends to be examined through data analysis operations such as seasonality and trend decomposition. 2018 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Internet of things (IoT) and digitalization of industries are changing the skills required from newly graduated engineers. To truly master these skills, they must be included in the curriculum, and a platform on which students can create IoT projects is needed. The research of IoT and related areas also benefits from such a platform. The platform presented in this paper focuses on a simple coffee maker but applies techniques and tools which are also used in larger scale projects, thereby making the system a valid solution for education. The devices and tools applied must be selected to satisfy education and research requirements. The proposed platform is built on IBM Cloud, and it uses Raspberry Pi as an edge device. Hands-on experience with a real IoT platform brings definite advantages that may otherwise be difficult to achieve. 2019 IEEE.</td>

So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we design and implement an IoT-based e-learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We analyse the performance of Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol in an indoor scenario. For evaluation we considered throughput, delay and jitter metrics. The experimental results show that the nodes in the testbed were communicating smoothly. Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Can your microwave be musical? What does it take to design devices that produce better sounds than the prototypical square wave beeps we are accustomed to hearing today? The authors have developed several prototyping toolkits for the rapid creation - sketching in hardware - of sonic and tangible interaction designs focusing on audio for interactive devices; specifically, producing higher-quality sound than the typical beeps so commonly heard from many digital devices today. Participants will learn how to create both completely self-contained devices for embedding into various objects or clothing, and wireless devices for the control of sound or music generated remotely. For example, studio creations can synthesize sound directly with an Arduino or a more powerful "Create USB Interface" board via Direct Digital Synthesis. Alternatively, they can control a program such as Pure Data (or other common software environments for audio processing) via innovative interfaces that send real-time inputs to such software running on a laptop, mobile device, or small Linux board (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Beagleboard). Basic hardware will be provided, but participants are also encouraged to bring related equipment they may already own. Copyright 2014 ACM.</td>

Although their introduction dates back to the 1980s, SDRs are now becoming the dominant technology in radio communications, thanks to the dramatic development of SP-optimized programmable hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and digital signal processors (DSPs). Today, the computational throughput of these devices is such that sophisticated SP tasks can be efficiently handled, so that both the baseband and intermediate frequency (IF) sections of current communication systems are usually implemented, according to the SDR paradigm, by the FPGA's reconfigurable circuitry (e.g., [4]-[6]), or by the software running on DSPs. 2016 IEEE.</td>

In most of the industries python programming language is widely used for various test automation. Initially the python language is introduced to implement numerical computation algorithms, so that the students are familiar with the basic libraries. Then the open ended experiment is carried out using Raspberry Pi for IOT applications. In this experiment the students are sensing and retrieving data from the cloud. With this approach the students are exposed to python programming and IOT concepts which is most widely used in industry.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Duckietown is an open, inexpensive and flexible platform for autonomy education and research. The platform comprises small autonomous vehicles ('Duckiebots') built from off-the-shelf components, and cities ('Duckietowns') complete with roads, signage, traffic lights, obstacles, and citizens (duckies) in need of transportation. The Duckietown platform offers a wide range of functionalities at a low cost. Duckiebots sense the world with only one monocular camera and perform all processing onboard with a Raspberry Pi 2, yet are able to: follow lanes while avoiding obstacles, pedestrians (duckies) and other Duckiebots, localize within a global map, navigate a city, and coordinate with other Duckiebots to avoid collisions. Duckietown is a useful tool since educators and researchers can save money and time by not having to develop all of the necessary supporting infrastructure and capabilities. All materials are available as open source, and the hope is that others in the community will adopt the platform for education and research. 2017 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Robotics and computational thinking are valuable tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy, and to promote inclusion and integration of students. We currently have a multitude of robotic education tools at our disposal. These tools arise with the aim of promoting innovation and student motivation during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our society today. Therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our everyday life. This work is focused on presenting Raspberry Pi as enhancer of educational robotics. The first step is presenting robotics as a tool for promoting the inclusion and integration of students. For this work a background and overview is also provided. The third part proposed different setups to prepare a Raspberry Pi for remote activities and robotics using Arduino as hardware interface. The last but not the least is an open discussion with the aim of exchanging impressions and getting feedback from the attendees.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Most universities are still using microprocessor training board that equipped with Intel 8086 to introduce students about assembly language and computer architecture due to its popularity and availability. The Intel 8086 is the first x86 microprocessor, it is no longer suitable to introduce students to the modern x86 architecture. A new microprocessor that featured modern architecture design is needed to maintain the competency of university students to keep pace with the fast advancing computer technology. Intel Galileo is a single board computer board that equipped with Intel Quark X1000 SoC. We successfully developed new approach for programming the device using assembly language. Supporting lab materials, example codes, macros, and procedures are developed to incorporate the Intel Galileo board into the laboratory experiments design for microprocessor course. The proposed laboratory experiments allow undergraduate students to learn IA-32 instruction sets and protected mode programming. The results from pre-post-test and quantitative survey shows that Intel Galileo board is effective to support the learning of the IA-32 assembly language and computer architecture.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The continuous dependency on technology has encouraged the integration of BeagleBone Black and C programming language in Universiti Tenaga Nasional in order to produce graduates that are active in the digital shift. The integration is introduced in the "Programming for Engineers" subject for first semester undergraduate students. However, the suitability of the syllabus as well as the integration needs to be observed. In order to achieve that, nine skills are set at the beginning of the semester, in which they will be assessed to observe their understanding of these skills at the end of the subject. The study is done for three different Bachelor degree programs in two consecutive semesters and the results show that they obtained at least 80&#37; of the skills acquired. This impressive percentage has proven the suitability of the integration between BeagleBone Black and C programming language for the first semester undergraduate students. 2016 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Humans are social creatures. We learn by connecting with those around us, through communication. While people with hearing or visual impairments alone can find a way to share their thoughts with others and understand them, deaf-blind people face a much more difficult communication task. Here, appropriate technology can play a decisive role. The small size and low power consumption of ARM-based computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, have opened the door for many embedded applications, including a heart monitoring method and an assistive navigation system for the blind. Some estimates place the number of deaf-blind people in the U.S. at around 40,000 individuals. While a commercial view considers this a small market, thus making communication devices not commercially viable; from a humanitarian view, this is a significant number of people who would greatly benefit from a technological means of communication. This paper presents the design, prototype and testing of a portable keyboard and speaker device with a braille refreshable display for the communication between two people (either being deaf- blind) that has both, a comparatively low cost, and many possibilities for further development on the ARM-based computer system. 2014 IEEE.</td>

We discuss important issues in creating hands-on labs for students in such a course, along with the experience of teaching this course at the graduate level. We expect other instructors interested in this area to benefit from our experience. We also offer suggestions for adapting this course at the undergraduate level. Our main finding is that students are very excited to learn about cutting-edge technologies, including fast growing programming languages and platforms. Specific hands-on laboratory exercises were developed on the Raspberry Pi platform in Python to teach students about the end-to-end processing involved in acquiring, analyzing, storing and transmitting temperature sensor data. These lab exercises provided students with a detailed understanding of the end-to-end processing involved in internet-of-things applications, including sensory data acquisition, storage, transmission, retrieval and analytics. The lab exercises made the course material accessible and engaging. This addresses one of the barriers to students entering and staying in STEM fields, which is the perceived dullness of the material taught. 2018 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The fields of computer science and engineering are undergoing rapid change, with significant advances in areas including the internet-of-things, cloud computing, and blockchain technologies. Consequently, the gap between traditional course material taught to students in B.S./M.S. programs at universities and the cutting edge of technology used in industry is widening at an unprecedented rate. Students may get overwhelmed and discouraged by the amount of material they need to learn, contributing to high dropout rates in STEM fields, particularly in computer science and engineering.We propose a hands-on laboratory based approach to teach the students the basics of these emerging areas. The objective is to motivate and engage students by encouraging them to tinker with physical systems, so that they can develop an intuitive understanding of the new technologies.We present an approach using the Raspberry Pi, a small and inexpensive platform that allows students to build interesting applications in the area of the internet-of-things. We provide the preferred sequencing of necessary material, and the required combination of different software modules necessary to teach the students. We discuss our experience of teaching this course to both graduate and undergraduate students.Our results should be beneficial to instructors interested in exposing their students to these emerging technologies. Our main finding is that students prefer hands-on laboratory exercises to theoretical instruction. They are able to grasp concepts better when there is a short theoretical lecture followed immediately by related hands-on laboratory exercises. We present specific laboratory exercises to teach students about the end-to-end processing involved in acquiring images, creating immutable records using a cryptographic hash function, and transmitting and storing them on the cloud. These lab exercises provide students with an understanding of camera-based security applications, basic blockchain technology, and cloud computing. 2019 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In modern days, there is a need for an effective, smart, and quick teaching methodologies helping students to have intelligent and thorough knowledge experience. Effective teaching depends on deliverable methods and moral learning environment. New trends in this regard have raised the term Internet of everything (IoE) which connects machine, people, and processes. This paper offers an IoE-based solution to upgrade teaching and learning processes. IoE covers the entire digital age with miniaturized operating system devices serving easy integration of large applications on these tiny devices. We present an innovative approach for creating a smart learning environment, in which teaching resources are automatically operated after entering credentials through a Web application. Learning strategy also supports recording functionality wherein teacher can record the lecture contents and students can view recorded lecture series and can also interact through the collaborative screen. All modules are being controlled through embedded computing device Raspberry Pi for hardware interfacing, Web application, intelligent media for controlling the resources, and scripting module for the collaborative screen. As different features are integrated into a centralized zone along with a modest and easily operated interface, this system results as a worthwhile and helpful for both teachers and students.

Use of computers and mobile devices in classrooms made the teaching and learning process more interactive. However, educational institutions across the world have not yet exploited the full benefits of developments in ICT. A new breed of computing devices, called Single Board Computers (SBC), have flooded the market. These devices are being used by technology enthusiasts across the world for developing IoT (Internet of Things) projects. In this paper, we have presented the use of a SBC named Raspberry Pi in conducting theoretical and practical classes of Undergraduate programs in IT and related fields. Our case study proves that SBCs can be used to impart educa tion in interesting as well as environment friendly manner. This case study can be used as a basis for implementing higher education in economic way in poor and middle income countries. Springer International Publishing AG 2017.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Instructional laboratories are common in engineering programs. Instructional laboratories should evolve with technology and support the changes in higher education, like the increased popularity of online courses. In this study, an affordable and portable laboratory kit was designed to replace the expensive on-campus equipment for two control systems courses. The complete kit costs under &dollar;135 and weighs under 0.68 kilograms. It is comprised of off-the-shelf components (e.g., Raspberry Pi, DC motor) and 3D printed parts. The kit has two different configurations. The first (base) configuration is a DC motor system with a position and speed sensor. The second configuration adds a Furuta inverted pendulum attachment with another position sensor. These configurations replicate most of the student learning outcomes for the two control systems courses for which they were designed. 2016 by the author.</td>

The tool is a low-cost Hardware in the Loop simulation with separated process model and control algorithm on standalone hardware which runs in real-time. In this paper, the simulation is used to control the steam turbine model with shaft and generator, but it can be used on wide range of complex physical models. The used model is evaluated on ramp-up simulation in Simulink, and after that mathematical equations are implemented in Modelica language and exported into Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU). The controlled and control models are both simulated on Raspberry Pi minicomputers in real-time and one can observe the control strategy on the second Raspberry with prepared control task and Human Machine Interface (HMI). Both Raspberries are connected through the Modbus over TCP/IP protocol and one can get familiar with this wide-used communication. Furthermore, there is possibility to control the system, change regulators parameters and handle the trade-off between various performances. Regulation can be operated in so-called island or grid mode. The aim of system control is to comply shaft speed demands described in norms. 2017 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Remote Laboratories are used in educational settings as tools to give students access to experiments that are not physically available to them at their institutions. During implementation, problems such as: bandwidth, security or limitations in terms of the usability, have been identified. This paper proposes an approach that integrates, what we call, a Smart Adaptive Remote Laboratory (SARL) with Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) to improve the students' experience by automatically adapting the experiments according to the student's current level of knowledge and experience. For this purpose, the laboratory experiment is connected with the VLE to access the student profile and academic information. This information is used by the SARL to adapt the educational content and the experimental interfaces accordingly. All students access the same set of equipment, but the adaptive system shows a variation of the graphic user interface with different controls and activities. The VLE provides the assessment component, completing the learning experience. The results of the experiments are stored in the remote laboratory system and sent back to the VLE to update the student information. A Raspberry Pi microcontroller and a web camera are used as hardware of the remote interface. The prototype software platform was implemented using Python and JavaScript languages and HTML 5 interface. The paper presents the design of the remote laboratory, the software integration model, and describes the details about the implementation of the prototype using this SARL strategy. 2017 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Middleware is a software layer located between software (operating system) and hardware (physical). This layer is flexible, where middleware can be built with a variety of features for many functions or even spesific tasks. Typically, middleware used in distributed system for software development. In this paper, the middleware created using Python parallel programming language and will be planted on Raspberry Pi 3. To help people learning IoT for basic, we create console apps for send and receiving command line data to access sensor or actuator. This middleware serves to translate a line of commands used to run or access the various features contained in IoT module. For the time efficiency of program function execution, multiprocessing or multithreading is used in Python. The multiprocessing or multithreading used in Python is expected to create middleware with distributed process for more efficient processor, to provide heterogeneity access of sensor or actuator, more simply hardware interfacing and to enhance collaboration between application and hardware. At the last, we compare multiprocessing and multithreading for CPU bond and memory usage. 2018 IEEE.</td>

A key cost and resource question in the development of IoT network sensor solutions is prototype implementation. In this study, the Raspberry Pi-a widely used single board computer-is investigated as it is one of the most commonly used prototyping devices available and is also widely used in scientific research. In this paper, we address which technologies, the usefulness and what kinds of issues arise when the prototyping of a sensor network solution is done with Raspberry Pi. The extant literature is studied by selecting papers with the systematic literature review method. Based on an extensive survey of the selected studies, we found several sensor-based implementations where Raspberry Pi has been used. In addition, this survey revealed subjects, such as e-health and education, which expanded the research topic in new ways. Further research opportunities have been identified in specifying the usefulness of various technologies with single board computers. 2017 Croatian Society MIPRO.</td>

Now the working principle of an underwater rover is not similar to a remotely controlled car or drone. So, a steel cable is of great necessity for a proper connection between the user at the host ship and the underwater rover as this is a remotely controlled rover. There lies a great variety of its application, it can be used for getting the live video or still pictures of the underwater life and all the underwater activities to learn about the underwater life. It makes the job for divers, rescuers and gem collectors easier as the rover gives the pictures, live video and all the other relevant details necessary for having a proper knowledge about the underwater elements.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: To provide reliable, time-saving and automatic class attendance system, the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) based class attendance monitoring system using embedded Linux platform is presented in this paper. The study is focused on the design and implementation of face detection and recognition system using Raspberry Pi. The system takes images of students, and analyzes, detects and recognizes faces using image processing algorithms, where the Haar cascade classifier algorithm is implemented to detect faces and local binary pattern histogram algorithm is used to recognize these faces. After collecting image processing data, the system generates a final attendance record and uploads it in a cloud server. The cloud server has been implemented using python based web framework. The record can be accessed remotely from a user-friendly, web application using the Internet. Finally, the system is also capable of sending an email notification with the final record to the teachers and students in a specific time. Tests and performance analysis were done to verify the efficiency of this system. 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Smart Grids have nowadays gained wide diffusion and relevance. Due to the complexity of the grid, many Smart Grids laboratories have emerged over the years to provide partially virtualized environments for testing and co-simulation testbeds for the modern grid. However, the costs for setting-up Smart Grids laboratories are substantial, representing a barrier for newcomers and for educational purposes. In this paper, we propose an hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) architectural solution based on Arduino and Raspberry PI boards, supported by the Mosaik framework to simulate different Smart Grids scenarios on a small and cost-effective scale. We highlight the educational benefits that the solution can bring for understanding simulations and HIL in an affordable effective way in an easy-to-deploy environment. 2017 IEEE.</td>

But the complexity to make the programs for build IOT applications are difficult for beginner developers. After analyzing the problems and conditions, we need an application that used to simplify text-based programming into visual based programming to make it easy to understand. This paper describes how to control IoT project easily using visual programming with android application over the internet. The application is created by describing the functions of IoT application with Raspberry, then writers made the communication protocol and user interface design based on classification of software construction elements with object modeling in order to be understood by the user. The practical goal of this paper is to continue the previous work from design into usable application, controlling education robot, learn IoT with RaspberryPi, make Bluetooth and internet connection through database, special additional features like conditional programming and monitoring output. The Software User Testing is used to rate the application and the result from the questionnaire with SUS methodology show that the application has a total score of 72,9 out of 100 which means it has an adjective ranking with 'Good' scale, Grade scale in 'C' category and 'Acceptable' in Acceptability scale that conclude this application is accented and easy to use. 2018 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Attendance management is one of the most important processes in an educational institute, since it is a way of evaluating the performance of the students, staff, and departments in it. Current attendance marking methods are monotonous and time-consuming. Manually recorded attendance can be easily manipulated. Maintaining attendance records integrity and security, and reducing the valuable amount of time and hassle spent in the overall process is a real challenge. We propose a system to tackle all these issues. Being one of the most successful applications of biometric verification, face recognition and fingerprint scanning have played an important role in the field of security, authorization, and authentication. Such forms of biometric verification can prove useful in case of students attendance collection. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that can be used to provide virtualized computing resources over the Internet to thin clients like a Raspberry Pi, which is a credit card-sized computing device with respectable performance. Combining the best of all three technologies, we propose an automated, wireless, biometric attendance management system that will run in an IaaS environment that will help to implement attendance marking process in a more efficient, simple, and time-saving fashion and also provide additional services which will be discussed ahead.

This academic project prototype was developed at the Brazilian Aeronautics Institute of Technology, on the second Semester of 2015. The project has involved 80 undergraduate and graduate students at the same time from four different electronic and computer engineering courses. The Scrum Framework was combined with Problem-Based Learning (PBL), to develop a prototype within just 17 academic weeks. The prototype was developed as a Proof of Concept (PoC) and applied within a natural disaster scenario management, involving the four segments of: Civil Defense, Health Care, Fire Department, and Police Department. At the end of the project, it was possible to deliver an integrated academic system project prototype, associating a Control Room with Web Applications connected through Cockpit Display Systems (CDSs). Students were able to work geographically dispersed, using free cloud-based tools, and the Safety Critical Application Development Environment (SCADE), from;ANSYS Esterel Technologies, combining multiple types of hardware like Raspberry Pi and Arduino, and different sets of open-source tools.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Programming a processor detached from real world is no longer a valid approach in Internet of the Things (IoT) era. Nowadays a processor must interact with sensors and actuators and also with others systems through internet. However, introducing IoT concepts in a didactic and easy way in beginners classes of computer architecture is not an easy task. In this paper we present the architecture of a didactic processor and simulator designed to seamlessly interact with sensors and actuators, intended to introduce IoT concepts in computer architecture and assembly language programming courses. This simulator can be executed on a Raspberry Pi nanocomputer, where it is possible to read and control sensors and actuators connected to the GPIO pins, directly from the code executed by the simulator. Another extension implemented in the simulator is the access to external microcontrollers, such as Arduino and NodeMCU, connected to a computer using Firmata protocol. This access is performed via USB or WiFi connection, and makes feasible to control any device connected to the microcontroller's pins. As far as we know, there is no other educational tool that offers such features, at this architectural level, freely available for use. 2018 IEEE.</td>

In order to build a comprehensive distributed file system, we used the laboratory consisting of 40 card-sized Raspberry Pi devices, with the accent on stability, scalability, and low cost. Aiming to assess the impact of this new learning environment on the learning process and its outcomes, we surveyed students following the completion of three project stages during the 17 laboratory exercises in one academic year, ensuring that we maintained the same subjects of study during the experiments. Supported by interesting answers on various sets of questions, we provide a valuable insight into students' experience, obstacles and observations during system's implementation. This particular insight paves the way toward further laboratory improvement, adopting this approach in other courses related to ours, and encouraging teachers to embrace similar practice regardless of the field of education. 1979-2012 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Nowadays the control education usually heavily relies on the available simulation packages and virtual laboratories, both of which have their irreplaceable position in the educational process. But unfortunately the closed loop experiments are way too often limited to these virtual domains and the students lack the physical feedback about the impact of control algorithms and its parameters. The reasons might be the price of the hardware setup to demonstrate the control algorithms physically or a complicated transition from simulation to real-time platform. This paper describes an extremely inexpensive, straightforward and surprisingly powerful platform for implementation of real-time control algorithms. The platform consists of an Arduino board and a Raspberry Pi running the REX Control System. The Arduino board is used for interaction with the physical world via its inputs and outputs. The REX Control System allows the students to develop and verify the control algorithms in Simulink and then run it in real-time by a few mouse clicks. However, the REX Control System is by no means dependent on Simulink, it is fully functional even if Simulink license is not available. The platform further bridges the gap between the virtual and physical worlds as it is tightly connected to PIDlab.com and Contlab.eu portals, which makes it an ideal choice for control education purposes.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Excluding hands-on experience with physical plants from control education is tempting in many aspects, but at the same time it is very dangerous. This paper explains why and recommends a compromise between demanding maintenance of physical plants for students to control and relying on pure numeric simulations within the whole curriculum. The golden mean might be the use of real-time simulators with physical inputs and outputs, i.e. hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulators. Three examples of HIL simulators are presented, covering a coupled tanks model, a quarter-car model and a nuclear reactor model. 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Incorporating hardware such as circuits with elements like sensors and actuators into online education platforms presents significant challenges, particularly when the learner and educator are not in the same location as one another. Open-ended design questions, can increase the challenges associated with assessment further still. In the past two years, we have been experimenting with ways to integrate varying degrees of automated grading and assessment for the hardware (circuits) designed and constructed by students in EECS-focused coursework at the secondary and undergraduate level, mostly in the context of embedded systems and controls using platforms like the Arduino/Teensy and Raspberry Pi. This work-in-progress paper briefly covers some ways we have gone about designing problems for hardware that can be assessed by online graders, lists a few example problem structures from several courses run over the past several years, and where we intend to take this work in the future. 2017 IEEE.</td>

Protomesh is a platform for starting up a quick ad-hoc batman-adv network. Batman-adv is an open source, kernel module native to Linux that provides a layer two mesh network routing protocol [2]. We leveraged this technology during Raspberry Pi workshops to use as a wireless infrastructure where students could freely access their Raspberry Pi across the mesh network. Network technologies such as this provide both an interactive and enriching experience. Protomesh enhances this experience by providing a solution for wireless connections and removing the burden of tethered Raspberry Pis. By allowing students to experience Raspberry Pi's wirelessly, students are enabled to explore a new horizon of embedded education. 2017 IEEE.</td>

This architecture is compliant with iLab Shared Architecture and is based upon open source software and hardware, in particular low cost platforms such as the Raspberry Pi 3. It consists of three main entities: user-side interface, experiment-side (lab) application and, interconnecting both, the cloud server enhanced with the messaging intermediator. Architecture takes into account typical requirements for educational institutions, such as open-source technologies, remote systems usage management (service brokerage) and security. In trial implementations, three single-user, remotely operated experiments have been enabled using ELSA-Py, in which students will be able to practice concepts of lean production (LyMIE), object position control (Windball) and image calibration (TabRecon). The integration has been tested and the performance of ELSA-Py architecture as a tool do deploy educational remotely operated systems is discussed. 2018 IEEE.</td>

This new development helps the university teachers to better introduce students to the concepts of new reconfigurable devices based on LabVIEW and using powerful and low price devices like Arduino and/or Raspberry PI 3 Model B. This methodology helps our students to develop their skills in Graphical Programming Language (LabVIEW) at the same time that also efficiently develop educational and industrial applications.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: For students of any Computer Engineering program, attaining an integrated vision of the different abstraction levels is paramount to fully understand and exploit a computer system, especially when tough topics such as parallelism, concurrency, consistency, or atomicity are involved at the hardware-software frontiers. However, the structure of typical engineering programs leads to the creation of self-contained courses, where a single level of abstraction is studied and the overall picture is lost. This paper provides a practical approach to show actual interactions between abstraction levels. This is achieved by implementing multiple components of a parallel ray tracer from the algorithmic level of the tracer to the atomic instructions required to guarantee atomicity. The students implement the full project throughout laboratories of different courses. Each lab focuses on a single abstraction level, but shows students the interactions with the rest of the levels. In addition, the hardware and software requirements of the approach are introduced, leading to the conclusion that Raspberry Pi is a suitable single-board computer for this project. Finally, this work also includes a preliminary assessment study of the proposed approach through the analysis of pre/post surveys filled out by the students. 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.</td>

Between 80 and 90&#37; of them evaluated the ability to use Raspberry Pi and implementing what they have learned so far to develop a relatively finished product as a motivation to continue working in the same field. Interestingly, almost 90&#37; are pleasantly surprised by what has been achieved. They would also like to continue to develop this project on their own or start a similar project as a diploma project.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Understanding, promoting, and teaching media literacy is an important societal challenge. STEM educators are increasingly looking to incorporate 21stcentury skills such as media literacy into core subject education. In this paper we investigate how undergraduate Computer Science (CS) students can learn media literacy as a by-product of collaborative video tutorial production. The paper presents a study of 34 third-year CS undergraduates who, as part of their learning, were each asked to produce three video tutorials on Raspberry Pi programming, using a collaborative video production tool for mobile phones (Bootlegger). We provide results of both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the production process and resulting video tutorials, and conclude that the student cohort demonstrated a clear development of media literacy skills. The paper's contribution is twofold. First, we add to the understanding of how the use of mobile collaborative video production technology by non-professionals can help them learn to create meaningful media messages with little scaffolding. Second, we present an alternative pedagogical approach that can help CS students acquire 21stcentury skills such as media literacy.</td>

To enhance the capabilities, using Raspberry PI, Version 2 of the PLC, costing |1,500 (&dollar;25) is made. We can use this device with the FOSS OpenPLC to learn ladder logic. We can also learn function block based programming using the FOSS 4DIAC.

To fully realise its driving potential, particularly in developing countries, a persistent knowledge teaching process for the Raspberry Pi is necessary. This paper presents a quasi-flipped learning model (QFLM) intended to spark critical and creative thinking and foster an entrepreneurial spirit early in a student's tertiary education life-cycle. The model was applied as part of a computer science component for third year students in the Electrical Information Engineering (E.I.E) Department of the University of Nairobi. Student programming confidence and completion of a time-bound project were used as model assessment metrics. It was found that the Raspberry Pi, coupled with the learning model, is a viable catalyst for local innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities. 2017 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: With rapid advances in the emerging and pervasive field of the Internet of Things, electrical and electronic engineering students need a robust grasp of embedded computational device principles to make a proper, appreciable and relevant contribution. This necessity is more pertinent in developing countries that are technologically lagging behind their developed counterparts. This paper analyses the teaching modalities and models used to teach embedded device theory. A new triumvirate (or three person group) hybrid blended learning model is proposed and used to instruct mid-level students in the Electrical and Information Engineering Department of the University of Nairobi; on two embedded device types: a custom board using an AVR Atmega88A series micro-controller and the Raspberry Pi single-board computer. Student circuit design ability and programming confidence prior and subsequent to the proposed method were used to assess the efficacy of the triumvirate model. From the preliminary iteration of the learning model program, it was found that the model is a viable method of ensuring persistent knowledge transfer of embedded design concepts and can be developed further. 2017 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Braille is an essential system of learning for visually challenged people. It is the method which enables them to read and write. The literacy rate in case of visually challenged people in many countries is very low. Various factors like lack of government initiatives, limitations of tutors, lack of personal attention etc. are the possible reasons for this state. Our project aims at developing a self-learning Braille kit which can help people with visual impairments. The solution aims at developing an easy to learn kit that will behave as a teacher and assists the visually challenged people for learning the Braille learning system. The designed system uses a Braille keypad and microphone to take input and produces speech as output. By implementing the designed system for visually challenged individuals, Braille literacy can be affected positively. The solution is so designed that it optimizes cost and speed of operation of the device. 2016 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Usually, the reason that virtual plant growing games cannot attract players attention is they cannot bring real game experience directly to players. In order to solve this problem, a plant growing game that combines virtuality with reality is designed and developed in this paper. Based on embedded hardware Arduino, Raspberry Pi and mobile terminals, game can change players online operating instructions into real-world action, greatly improving the authenticity and fun of game. Experiments show that the game can run effectively. 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Onboard transit systems are commonly used for commutes to and from home, work and other destinations. However, this is generally not productive time with commuters often gazing out of the window. Other systems have proposed a solution to this problem however, they are offline and would require each device on each vehicle to be updated manually. In this paper, we present an onboard educational Wi-Fi system that offers educational content which can be updated remotely as well as free internet access to particular commuters. Also, specific users can be allowed to browse the internet by connecting wirelessly while onboard. Additionally, Edu-Bus can be used as an educational tool, requiring persons to watch an educational video or read some educational content before gaining access to Edu-Bus services such as free Wi-Fi. Our system uses a Raspberry Pi which is converted into a wireless hotspot, as well as an optional USB or Wi-Fi modem to connect to the 3G/4G provider. Additionally, Edu-Bus can be powered directly from an adapter using the vehicles cigarette lighter outlet or temporarily from its internal battery. We implemented this work on-board a fleet of four (4) buses at the University of The West Indies Cave Hill Campus. We analyzed student connections to the system generated by user activities. Our approach to this problem not only makes Edu-Bus extendable but also introduces the ability to deploy similar systems on varying vehicle types and modes of transportation. 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: One of the primary goals of computer science education is preparing students to apply what they learn in the classroom to any problem they may encounter in the future. Due to the rapidly changing landscape of technology, regardless of the comprehensiveness of their coursework, at some point students will be required to apply their knowledge to a context they have not encountered before, and understand how what they have learned applies. One of the content areas where this is particularly relevant is helping students recognize the variety of technologies and applications in which object oriented design patterns can produce significant practical benefits. To foster this aptitude, we sought to leverage the students' own creativity with a Raspberry Pi and a multitude of sensors, displays, cameras, and actuators to boost exploration of technologies and student understanding of how course concepts apply outside of constructed examples. This paper presents the experience of using student creativity with the Raspberry Pi to drive their learning in an upper level software design patterns course. 2017 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Due to the opportunities provided by the Internet, people are taking advantage of e-learning courses and enormous research efforts have been dedicated to the development of e-learning systems. So far, many e-learning systems are proposed and used practically. However, in these systems the e-learning completion rate is low. One of the reasons is the low study desire and motivation. In this work, we present an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We carried out some experiments with a student of our laboratory for brain waves and, encryption and decryption time of cipher algorithms. We used MindWave Mobile (MWM) to get the data. For experimental results, when using our system the concentration is 80 [&#37;] from 0 [s] to 400 [s]. But, for 400 [s] to 1000 [s], concentration is decreased. In the case of not using our system, concentration is almost the same (about 40 [&#37;]) from 0 [s] to 1000 [s]. From simulation results, we found that the decryption time is faster than encryption time, however for 3-DES and Raspberry Pi decryption time is higher than encryption time.

The ground breaking project is an IoT green roof monitoring system for environmental surveillance on the roof of a campus building. The IoT monitoring system helps with both student experiential education and data driven analytics on green roof benefits. It also serves as a smart campus research site for other IoT systems. The entire project will be completed in several phases. In this paper, we focus on IoT security in current implementation where the IoT system is attached to campus network. In particular, we explore authentication and credential update schemes for access control to protect both the IoT system and campus network. Moreover, the security features are proposed to keep the IoT system relatively easy to manage by system administrator and students. In this work, the proposed schemes are demonstrated using a BeagleBone board as a IoT node. 2017 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In today's environment, where every computer, including cell phones, are multicore, it is essential that students develop parallel programming skills. It remains a challenge to develop effective techniques for teaching parallel programing skills. Another challenge is finding time within already packed lectures to cover additional material. To that end, we investigate the effectiveness of using Project Based Learning (PBL) to teach parallel programming skills early in the curriculum by developing and incorporating a PBL module into CSc 3210 (Computer Organization and Programming). This is a core course taken by all computer science majors and is a prerequisite to many of our senior-level classes. In our case study, 124 students are organized into 26 diverse groups, with four or five students per group, and assigned five project assignments, each of two-weeks duration. Given a Raspberry PI, students will explore its multicore architecture and create programs for shared memory parallelism using OpenMP and C language. Our results show that incorporating this PBL module has a significant and direct effect on the student's growth in parallel programming skills. As a side benefit, we also show that there is a direct improvement on a student's personal growth in terms soft skills, which is essential in the professional development and success in the workplace. By having students experience PBL in an early class, close to the midpoint of the academic program, it can serve as a mini-capstone project. Furthermore, students can collaboratively learn by themselves (through teamwork) and apply the fundamentals of parallel programming skills without the need for separate lectures, labs, or workshops. 2019 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: (work in progress). In 2012, Ebon Upton started the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which introduced the Raspberry Pi (RPi) as a &dollar;35 basic computer. The goal was to reignite public interest in programming and increase enrollment in college computer science. Today, the third RPi iteration features a multicore processor, a small GPU for display graphics, WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity. Surprisingly, even though the RPi has become very popular with the public and college students for do-it-yourself projects and maker culture, instructors have not widely used it to teach operating systems concepts. In this paper, I share my experience using the RPi in my Operating Systems class. The paper makes the following contributions: Pedagogical advantages of using the RPi over other traditional and cloud-based methods to teach operating systems concepts Challenges for the instructor and students running many RPis in a classroom setting over the campus enterprise network. Advantages of using the RPi to stimulate student creativity and motivate them to design and implement their own related computing projects. 2017 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper describes the design and implementation of GridTeractions, a scalable framework for teaching and testing advanced distribution automation strategies in smart grids. GridTeractions provides a hardware-software platform to interact with online running simulation of distribution systems. The interactive approach leads to fast learning processes for power systems students. Besides, the detailed modeling and continuous results emulate the real systems' operation. This feature allows realistic feedback for testing and design of future automation strategies. The platform uses network communications with Human-Machine Interfaces developed in microprocessor terminals (Raspberry PI 2) to achieve multi-terminal operation. Systems are modeled with OpenDSS scripts and managed by DSSim-PC in order to run simulations in time series with phase domain results, allowing users to continuously evaluate the electrical variables. This paper includes the architecture description, implementation details and validations based in the IEEE test feeders. 2016 IEEE.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In the new era of AI and IoT, it's crucial to guide students to learn principles of computer systems design with both hardware (HW) and software (SW), or at least equip them with a HW-SW co-design concept. To overcome the lack of hardware reconfigurability in conventionally leveraged single-board computers (SBCs, e.g., Raspberry Pi) in class, this poster delivers ZyCube, a heterogeneous 4-node SoC-FPGA mini-cluster. These four nodes are orchestrated in a manner of on-demand network service to support a dozen of students to agilely and simultaneously conduct computer systems projects. Three capacity-building course projects are shown with ZyCube, which are (1) HW design of a simplified CPU core with performance profiling using C-language microbenchmarks, (2) rapid co-design of a deep neural network inference accelerator with the CPU core, and (3) datapath optimization with a co-designed DMA engine. These projects are believed to help students to obtain a comprehensive perspective of HW-SW coordination and teachers to leverage a similar platform and pedagogy in their courses. 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: With the development of Remote Laboratory Management Systems, toolkits and software frameworks that streamline development, deployment and management of Online Laboratories it is possible to observe trends towards a systematisation of the different components necessary to deliver online experimentation to students and pupils. The Go-Lab platform and its services for lab owners, such as the smart device and smart gateway are examples of frameworks that simplify the plug and share of remote laboratories. However, the lab owner is still responsible for provisioning the IT resources necessary to deliver the remote labs. This work proposes a framework that can simplify even more the deployment of labs, contributing for a more ubiquitous delivery of these systems, since it minimises the requirements posed to lab owners to connect an equipment to the Internet. This approach if fully compatible with the Smart Device specification of Go-Lab, since it proposes a new layer of abstraction for lab owners. Additionally, as a result of these minimised requirements, Online Laboratory installations can run on single-board computers, such as a Raspberry Pi, what ultimately contribute to a more ubiquitous deployment of remote experimentation. This paper will describe how a software framework called Experiment Dispatcher developed to simplify the development and deployment of Online Laboratories facilitates the ubiquitous deployment of these systems. 2016 IEEE.</td>
