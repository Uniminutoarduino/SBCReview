N2  - The Raspberry Pi platform provides true equal opportunity-of-use in computing globally. From it, new affordable research and industrial opportunities have emerged. To fully realise its driving potential, particularly in developing countries, a persistent knowledge teaching process for the Raspberry Pi is necessary. This paper presents a quasi-flipped learning model (QFLM) intended to spark critical and creative thinking and foster an entrepreneurial spirit early in a student's tertiary education life-cycle. The model was applied as part of a computer science component for third year students in the Electrical  Information Engineering (E.I.E) Department of the University of Nairobi. Student programming confidence and completion of a time-bound project were used as model assessment metrics. It was found that the Raspberry Pi, coupled with the learning model, is a viable catalyst for local innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - One of the primary goals of computer science education is preparing students to apply what they learn in the classroom to any problem they may encounter in the future. Due to the rapidly changing landscape of technology, regardless of the comprehensiveness of their coursework, at some point students will be required to apply their knowledge to a context they have not encountered before, and understand how what they have learned applies. One of the content areas where this is particularly relevant is helping students recognize the variety of technologies and applications in which object oriented design patterns can produce significant practical benefits. To foster this aptitude, we sought to leverage the students' own creativity with a Raspberry Pi and a multitude of sensors, displays, cameras, and actuators to boost exploration of technologies and student understanding of how course concepts apply outside of constructed examples. This paper presents the experience of using student creativity with the Raspberry Pi to drive their learning in an upper level software design patterns course.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to present the new, innovative teaching approach and tinkering pedagogy towards developing the students skills in STEM domains (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) with aim to the designing the laboratory for radiation detector development. Involving from one side concept of social situatedness and connectedness, and from another the concept of independent, self-directed and self-regulated student learning, the project was based on assembling the mini-lab, Radiation Sensor Board for Arduino, that was originally designed to help people in Japan to measure levels of radiation in their everyday life after the Fukushima accident. As it was reported elsewhere, this product was an example of crowdsourcing. When Libelien designed the Radiation Sensor Board for Waspmote, the idea was simple: with the Arduino platform people will be able to have easily running their own detector at home while on the other hand with Waspmote platform authorities will be able to deploy autonomous sensor networks to send the radiation levels from dangerous areas using wireless sensor platform ZigBee and GPRS technologies. This paper present students developing project where the Sensor Board for Arduino was used as assembling, teaching tool. The Do-It-Yourself and Internet of Things can be used both in educational, and in the research and development purposes. Owning their own mini-lab at their disposal anytime, students worked at their learning speed. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students and highly affected three domains of learning: cognitive domain (activities like instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, data analysis and design, psychomotor domain (activities like manipulating the apparatus, sensory awareness) and affective domain (behavior and attitudes to learn from failure, creativity, collaborative communication, safety and ethics in the laboratory). We show that networking learning, supported by hands-on labs on chip, and an open source electronics prototyping platform as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, give great opportunities for teaching and learning the tinkering and inventing skills, an request we have to deal with it at the University of Montenegro. Such project support exploratory and serendipitous learning. It moved teching from an emphasis simply on linear logic and programmed instruction, towards non-linear, networked, branching, hypertext views of learning, in which connections between knowledge are made and developed. It is based on principle of situated cognition and Vigotskian thought: situatedness, commonality, interdependency and infrastructure where learning is fascinated by an activity. The presented project integrate a Virtual Learning Environment, networking knowledge and student-owned movable laboratory on the chip, where radiation was used as a topic and where electronics was embedded and embodied.  2015 RAD Conference Proceedings.

N2  - In order to further education in embedded discovery, Protomesh (prototype mesh) seeks to improve the field by providing a wireless solution for deploying Raspberry Pi workshops. Protomesh is a platform for starting up a quick ad-hoc batman-adv network. Batman-adv is an open source, kernel module native to Linux that provides a layer two mesh network routing protocol [2]. We leveraged this technology during Raspberry Pi workshops to use as a wireless infrastructure where students could freely access their Raspberry Pi across the mesh network. Network technologies such as this provide both an interactive and enriching experience. Protomesh enhances this experience by providing a solution for wireless connections and removing the burden of tethered Raspberry Pis. By allowing students to experience Raspberry Pi's wirelessly, students are enabled to explore a new horizon of embedded education.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The objective of this 'work-in-progress' paper is to describe a Raspberry Pi based learning center management system that assists in deciding resource allocation for a peer-instruction driven engineering tutoring center. Data gathered from the usage of the engineering tutoring center allows for cost-effective staffing through recognition of the center's usage trends. The data collected may be structured per the center administrator's requirements and presented real-time on dashboards. The flexibility of this Raspberry Pi system allows for it to be developed into a full fledged learning management system with integrated analytics as required for a particular curriculum. This system is highly cost-effective as compared a commercial web-based system. This prototype has saved approximately 12 hours a month of time, for data retrieval and analysis as compared to a previously used commercial web-based system. At the moment, this Raspberry Pi data tracking system has been installed only in a single tutoring center on-campus. Deployment of this across a university campus would allow accumulated usage trends to be examined through data analysis operations such as seasonality and trend decomposition.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper describes a pilot study to evaluate its use for teacher Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in Computer Science (CS) using the Bridge21 model, a particular model of 21st century teaching and learning. A range of introductory Computer Science workshops are evaluated that include topics such as; Computational Thinking, Scratch, Raspberry Pi and Python. This paper includes a detailed look at the generalized activity model used in all Bridge21 activities. Combining the Kirkpatrick training evaluation theory with ethnographic methods the researchers analyzed qualitative and quantitative data gathered from 110 in-service teachers whom attended 9 CS CPD workshops. Using the Kirkpatrick framework as a taxonomy with which to code data relating to (a) teachers initial reactions towards the workshops and (b) intentions towards use of the Bridge21 model for supporting CS classroom delivery. Findings indicate that teachers initial reactions towards the programme were positive and that teachers intend to use the model in their classroom.

N2  - During the last years many virtual laboratories have been developed, but not all of them were successfully adopted. Designing, planning and creating a virtual laboratory can be a very difficult process, which can get even more complicated if the laboratory has to provide access to real equipment. One of the most problematic steps when developing such virtual laboratories is the selection of the right access method. At the present moment of time there are many technologies that allow users to access devices remotely. One of these possible solutions is to use the Telnet/SSH protocols for remote access. Nevertheless, the use of these protocols require at least one active network interface per device, which in some cases can present a problem. There are some other drawbacks of using Telnet/SSH for remote access as well - virtual laboratories are often created with the purpose to be used in the education process, which means that the users of these systems in most cases are students. These less experienced users might accidently delete the configuration of the interface that is dedicated for the remote access, which will result in the immediate loss of connection to the device and will require administrator intervention to fix this access issue. An alternative solution to provide remote access is to use a console server. A detailed analysis on the possibilities for remote access using console servers, present them as reliable, but also as a very expensive solutions. In this paper we will investigate the possibilities to replace the expensive console servers with much cheaper devices. One such device is the Raspberry Pi - a low cost device that was developed to enhance the education process of children and students in the field of the computer sciences and their related subjects. In this paper we will investigate and compare the characteristics of the Raspberry Pi to the most widely used console servers and we will present a way to use the Raspberry Pi as a console server for remote access to telecommunication routers and switches.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - This paper shows the building of an embedded Asterisk platform as a key technique for providing Information Technology classes with an extra laboratorial environment for learning Voice over Internet Protocol. Besides building the platform, the students are asked to mount a functional telephony system with it that meets the criteria of low cost, low building complexity and high adaptability to convergent networks. The Raspberry PI version B was the board used to provide portability for the students to work outside the laboratory environment. Asterisk was presented as a useful tool on which the students could create a flexible system that could be easily deployed on convergent networks. This work was developed in the Telephony subject for the Electrical Engineering and the Telecommunications Systems undergraduate courses from the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Paraiba - IFPB, and presented good results in the students' learning achievements.

N2  - This paper describes the ideas of using Raspberry Pi computers in high schools and higher education. Raspberry Pi is a powerful computer in a size of a credit card. It was created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation charity, whose primary goal was the re-introduction of computer skills learning among students. The Raspbian operating system is based on Linux and offers an excellent working environment for students, as it includes software solutions designed to expand students' knowledge of computer science in an interesting way. Besides computer science knowledge, it is also suitable for acquiring basic knowledge in electronics. It is also very important to have the possibility of interconnecting such acquired knowledge. Our students have adopted the knowledge how to install and use the Raspbian operating system, how to network and connect to the Internet, how to write programs using the Python programming language, and how to develop hardware-based projects. From our own experience in Raspberry Pi we can conclude that this is an ideal platform for students to acquire new knowledge and competences in the field of computer science and electronics.  42nd International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics, MIPRO 2019 - Proceedings.

N2  - This article presents an alternative architechture implementation with the purpose of provide real experiments of remote access and expand teaching practices focused on experimentation toward physics education. The research uses a low cost open hardware and an available multiplatform with open source applications. With this initiative, lab resources can be accessed from schools, as many of them have not appropriate science lab for practical activities. This reserch have been applied in two public schools from Ararangua/SC that also face difficulties when using the computer lab. As a solution, the students use their own mobile devices to do science and physics experiments accessing, controlling and observing real experiments installed in the Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab). Making new experiments is a collaborative work with the teachers of these schools and with the lab staff to adapt their idea to a low cost system with the Raspberry Pi. The study presented here intends to facilitate the experiments adaptation and motivate other research labs to make their experiments available.  2015 IEEE.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi is a single board computer (SBC) priced at 35 USD  less than the cost of many textbooks. The current model (3B) includes a quad-core ARM 64-bit CPU, 1 GB of RAM, a 2-core GPU, and numerous communication ports, including USB, HDMI, Ethernet, WiFi and Bluetooth. This combination of low cost and high functionality creates many new pedagogical possibilities for CS educators, ranging from using the Raspberry Pi to teach assembly language to using it as a multiprocessor. Relatedly, mathematics educators have produced an extensive literature on the use of pedagogical tools known as "manipulatives" that have been shown to be effective at starting students through a "concrete, representational, abstract" progression of understanding of an abstract topic (e.g., [1-5, 7]). In this approach, students interact with a manipulative that provides a "concrete" representation of a mathematical abstraction; subsequent pedagogy using representations of the abstraction (usually pictures) help the student start building a mental model of the abstraction; further pedagogy using a symbolic representation helps the student extend their mental model and progress to a more nuanced understanding of the abstraction. The basic idea dates back to Papert, who called manipulatives "objects-to-think-with" [6]. Subsequent research has shown this approach to be effective at improving student mastery of a wide variety of mathematical abstractions, ranging from algebra [2], to fractions and ratios [4], to computation and problem-solving [1,3]. Other researchers have noted that manipulatives can make learning enjoyable and fun [5]. We believe this same "concrete, representational, abstract" progression can be used to help students master many CS topics that are often taught as abstractions. More precisely, the Raspberry Pi can be used as a manipulative to provide students with a concrete representation of specific CS topics ranging from CPUs to primary vs. secondary storage to distributed multiprocessors; topics that would  in the absence of a concrete representation  remain fuzzy abstractions to students. By providing a "concrete" foundation on which to build, a SBC like the Raspberry Pi (R-Pi) can provide the first step in helping students build mental models of such abstractions, and thus enhance student learning. Like [5], our experience also suggests that many students find the R-Pi to be a fun and enjoyable way to learn about these abstractions.  2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - The recent development of the Raspberry Pi mini computer has provided new opportunities to enhance tools for education. The low cost means that it could be a viable option to develop solutions for education sectors in developing countries. This study describes the design, development and manufacture of a prototype solution for educational use within schools in Uganda whilst considering the social implications of implementing such solutions. This study aims to show the potential for providing an educational tool capable of teaching science, engineering and computing in the developing world. During the design and manufacture of the prototype, software and hardware were developed as well as testing performed to define the performance and limitation of the technology. This study showed that it is possible to develop a viable modular based computer systems for educational and teaching purposes. In addition to science, engineering and computing; this study considers the socioeconomic implications of introducing the EPi within developing countries. From a sociological perspective, it is shown that the success of EPi is dependant on understanding the social context, therefore a next phase implementation strategy is proposed.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - By design, the computer science curriculum for undergraduate students in the United States does not include enough hands-on courses such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. It is difficult for students, especially the Distance Learners (DL) to appreciate the power of computer science as a problem-solving field without real-world experiments. Furthermore, students in computer science may drop-out or turn away from the field because it does not offer an opportunity for them to communicate with each other during online/traditional labs. In this paper, an active learning project-based approach in online/traditional computer science courses is introduced to make the courses' material more attractive to students from minorities. Students obtain a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world problems. Students will enjoy the challenges they face when developing solutions. This paper studies the impact of hands-on project-based learning using Raspberry Pi on students taking online and face-To-face computer science courses at Old Dominion University.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - With the requirement that parallel  distributed computing (PDC) topics be covered in the core computer science curriculum, educators are exploring new ways to engage students in this area of computing. In this paper, we discuss the use of the Raspberry Pi single-board computer (SBC) to provide students with hands-on multicore learning experiences. We discuss how the authors use the Raspberry Pi to teach parallel computing, and present assessment results that indicate such devices are effective at achieving CS2013 PDC learning outcomes, as well as motivating further study of parallelism. We believe our results are of significant interest to CS educators looking to integrate parallelism in their classrooms, and support the use of other SBCs for teaching parallel computing.  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The aim of this work is to create a working GPS tracker for cars with a web administration interface. The web application design was based on the similar solutions that already exist and needs of potential users. The GPS tracker is based on Raspberry Pi 3 board, which is widely available and is a perfect learning tool for students wanting to learn basics about software-hardware interaction. Whole work was divided into simpler tasks, which could be solved on a regular week basis. Students were divided into two groups based on their preferences. Main task for the first group was to assemble and program the GPS tracker based on the Raspberry Pi Zero board using GPS and GSM modules. The second group needed to develop a web application which will store and manage data from the tracker. The complete solution was then tested with real data and evaluated by real users. Students were then given a questionnaire to provide feedback on this type of group project and the results were mainly positive.  2018 IEEE.

The AOLME project uses an integrated curriculum that relies on the use of basic concepts from middle-school mathematics to teach the foundations of image and video representations. The middle-school students, mostly from underrepresented groups, learn how to program their own video representations using Python libraries running on the Raspberry Pi. Overall, we have found that the students enjoy participating in the project.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - This paper describes how low cost but innovative hardware device as Raspberry Pi can be used in education as a tool for an implementation of generalizing project. The use of this device helped students apply what they have learned during their bachelor's degree. At the end of the project all 45 students completed a survey. Between 80 and 90% of them evaluated the ability to use Raspberry Pi and implementing what they have learned so far to develop a relatively finished product as a motivation to continue working in the same field. Interestingly, almost 90% are pleasantly surprised by what has been achieved. They would also like to continue to develop this project on their own or start a similar project as a diploma project. More than 95% of the students are very satisfied from their own results and also from team working. We evaluate these results as promising.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Most universities are still using microprocessor training board that equipped with Intel 8086 to introduce students about assembly language and computer architecture due to its popularity and availability. The Intel 8086 is the first x86 microprocessor, it is no longer suitable to introduce students to the modern x86 architecture. A new microprocessor that featured modern architecture design is needed to maintain the competency of university students to keep pace with the fast advancing computer technology. Intel Galileo is a single board computer board that equipped with Intel Quark X1000 SoC. We successfully developed new approach for programming the device using assembly language. Supporting lab materials, example codes, macros, and procedures are developed to incorporate the Intel Galileo board into the laboratory experiments design for microprocessor course. The proposed laboratory experiments allow undergraduate students to learn IA-32 instruction sets and protected mode programming. The results from pre-post-test and quantitative survey shows that Intel Galileo board is effective to support the learning of the IA-32 assembly language and computer architecture.

N2  - This paper presents the idea about how to combine a set of software and hardware resources available in literature to be used as support to control engineering education. The available tools allow to mix topics related to programming, communications, operating systems, and control theory. The well-known Raspberry Pi board is used as platform to exploit the different proposed concepts. SciPy, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries, which are Python-based open-source libraries for scientiffc computing and graphical representation, are used to perform Matlab-like simulations and to implement classical control loops. On the other hand, virtual processes developed in Easy Java Simulations are adapted to be controlled through the network from a controller implemented on the Raspberry Pi with Python. This option is very useful from a teaching point of view since time-based, networked-based, or event-based control approaches can be easily introduced on this proposed architecture. Furthermore, once students know how to implement control loops on the Raspberry Pi using Python, external real processes can be easily controlled by using the GPIO interface available in the this electronic board. Then, a project based on these tools and ideas is motivated and presented in this paper to control a two-tank level process.  2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Nowadays the control education usually heavily relies on the available simulation packages and virtual laboratories, both of which have their irreplaceable position in the educational process. But unfortunately the closed loop experiments are way too often limited to these virtual domains and the students lack the physical feedback about the impact of control algorithms and its parameters. The reasons might be the price of the hardware setup to demonstrate the control algorithms physically or a complicated transition from simulation to real-time platform. This paper describes an extremely inexpensive, straightforward and surprisingly powerful platform for implementation of real-time control algorithms. The platform consists of an Arduino board and a Raspberry Pi running the REX Control System. The Arduino board is used for interaction with the physical world via its inputs and outputs. The REX Control System allows the students to develop and verify the control algorithms in Simulink and then run it in real-time by a few mouse clicks. However, the REX Control System is by no means dependent on Simulink, it is fully functional even if Simulink license is not available. The platform further bridges the gap between the virtual and physical worlds as it is tightly connected to PIDlab.com and Contlab.eu portals, which makes it an ideal choice for control education purposes.

N2  - This full paper proposes an educational methodology to teaching and learning of programming using both open hardware tools and industrial components such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, three phase motors and variable speed drives. The methodology aims to improve the algorithmic thinking in the students due to the deficiencies detected in it, as well as, it searches that the students learn a second programming language, using hands-on designs and activities that require the components mentioned. In addition, the methodology has been employed into the curriculum of a course of programming known as (open hardware) for students of technology in electronics (n = 22), observing that the students learn programming concepts in a better way and their motivation and engagement towards the software area was increased during the course. To technical level, the methodology uses the programming language Python in order to interact with the different ports, peripherals and utilities of the platforms mentioned, creating a link between these elements and the aspects concerning the software design, e.g., data types, classes, methods or Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Finally, the methodology takes into account two important aspects, firstly, the skills developed by the students in the proposal are involved into the BoK (Body of Knowledge) of different engineering areas as embedded systems, control and computer science and, secondly, programming is perhaps one of the most difficult areas in engineering but in turn, it has a ubiquitous nature in the areas mentioned.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper firstly describes the development and evaluation of a project course which yields university students building a complete hardware and software chain for a digital image processing application. To arouse the interest and learning initiative of students, we propose them to build a setup including a Raspberry Pi and image processing programmes. This inexpensive single board computer answers todays issues in energy saving and permits to review fundamental hardware and software principles. Secondly, we propose a low-cost setup for a time-limited practical work: a Raspberry Pi is shared and controlled remotely by several student pairs: we emphasize the interest of collaborative work, and we provide knowledge and skills about micro-computers to a large number of students simultaneously.

N2  - With the development of the teaching and research of big data processing and distributed algorithms, there emerges an increasing need to leverage low-cost hardware to build the distributed computing test environment for the purpose of the algorithm validation and experiment simulation. In this paper, we propose a distributed computing testbed using the affordable Raspberry Pi board as the basic computing unit. We develop a cluster platform by building and assembling the units, and design a containerized service-computing framework by merging LXC and service computing techniques. Three kinds of services are introduced and configured to implement specific workflow orchestration on demand. For convenience, we develop a visualized user interface to manage cluster, deploy service containers, and manage workflows. We present the containerized service workflow that links the components of data source, distributed data processing and visualization, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed testbed.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Sustainable Environmental Development is one of the hot topics nowadays. Industries were advised to reduce and control pollution by using pollution control equipment. Computers are also contributing some amount in the pollution and power consumption. On the other hand, miniaturization, less power consumption, and environment-friendly devices are invented by the researchers every day. One such device is Raspberry Pi. Size of the Raspberry Pi is not bigger than a credit card with high computing capacity and low power consumption. Pi can run Linux as well as Windows 10 in its higher versions. This paper aims to suggest the Pi can be used for practicing most of the laboratory courses in the computer science engineering curriculum. Most laboratory courses are practiced in C, C++, and Java languages. Apart from above-mentioned languages, some laboratory courses make use of front end and back end tools. Above-mentioned languages can be executed in Raspberry Pi. Following points are analyzed between normal computer and Pi, execution time, power consumption, and environmental effect. In all the comparison, Pi gives much higher advantage over existing system.  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

N2  - In this paper, we explore the Raspberry pi 2 B+ (RPI) graphics in terms of electrical power and energy. We use a novel method to correlate graphics processing, CPU load and electrical power consumption and total energy. By using different benchmarks both with and without the GPU rendering and a Power Gauge, the power consumption difference between GPU rendering and software rendering can be measured. Our results are showing that the number of frames rendered per second increases dramatically when hardware rendering is used, as does electrical power. Interestingly, because the hardware rendering takes less time, we have found that the total energy consumed per rendered frame can be lower despite the electrical power during hardware rendering being higher.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - In Information Technology (IT) education, hands-on experience through the lab is crucial because students tends to learn thing better when observing how practically it's been applied in real system. In general, the lab in IT education requires a variety of equipment such as PCs, servers, switches, and etc., which are relatively expensive. Due to this reason, virtual environment has played a big role in IT education since virtually multiple systems can be created, modified, tested, and deleted easily with little or no cost. However, virtual system still requires at least one PC and its capability is limited to providing additional Operating System (OS). Recently, emergence of Raspberry Pi provides a small and affordable computer, which is utilized in many different areas. This emerging technology has not been explored well to be adopted in IT education. In this paper, we will introduce and investigate Raspberry Pi and discuss its effectiveness in IT education. We will also introduce the building process of a low cost hands-on lab environment setup using Raspberry Pi.  American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.

N2  - The 2013 ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines highlight the importance of teaching parallel computing to undergraduates in higher education. Universities have responded to this need, but there remains a hole in most curricula. While techniques for parallelizing code and using tools such as MPI and OpenMP seem to be well covered, concepts of shared versus distributed memory and race conditions are often taught only at an abstracted level. Using the educational operating system Embedded Xinu, students can write ARM assembly code that makes use of instructions meant specifically for multicore interaction. By having students implement exercises such as the coupon collector's problem, they can gain a much deeper understanding of potential issues with sharing memory and maintaining cache coherence. This added curriculum fits with existing computer organization courses and helps to prepare students for future work in parallel computing. This paper presents specific enhancements used with the Embedded Xinu operating system and its associated ARM Playground, as well as a pilot study using the new curriculum with undergraduates in a typical hardware systems course.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Bridge21 is a particular model of 21st Century teaching and learning and this paper describes a pilot study to evaluate its use for teacher Continuing Profecional Development (CPD) in Computer Science (CS). The CPD programme covered a range of introductory Computer Science topics including; Computational Thinking, Scratch, Raspberry Pi Input/Outputs and Python. The researchers combined training programme evaluation theory (Kirkpatrick, 1994) with ethnographic methods (Fetterman, 1987) to analyze qualitative and quantitative data gathered from 110 in-service teachers whom attended 9 CS CPD workshops. The Kirkpatrick framework was used as a taxonomy against which to code data relating to (a) teachers reactions towards the CS CPD programme and (b) intentions towards use of the Bridge21 model for supporting CS clacroom delivery. A combination of coding procedures generated four themes that addrec two research questions. Question one explored to what extent the 21st Century learning model proved effective for CS CPD programme delivery, while question two explored the extent to which teachers intended to use the learning model for delivery of CS topics in the clacroom. Findings indicate that teachers' initial reactions towards the programme were positive and that teachers intend to use the model for their CS delivery.

N2  - Excluding hands-on experience with physical plants from control education is tempting in many aspects, but at the same time it is very dangerous. This paper explains why and recommends a compromise between demanding maintenance of physical plants for students to control and relying on pure numeric simulations within the whole curriculum. The golden mean might be the use of real-time simulators with physical inputs and outputs, i.e. hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulators. Three examples of HIL simulators are presented, covering a coupled tanks model, a quarter-car model and a nuclear reactor model.  2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - It is widely recognized that motivating students in an undergraduate assembly language course is a tremendous challenge, principally because of the perception that the subject matter is both difficult and tedious. The Raspberry Pi is a small and inexpensive single-board computer that was created for educational purposes, and in this paper we describe how we successfully incorporated this device into the curriculum of an undergraduate assembly language course. We describe, in detail, the objectives for this course and the dedicated lab that uses the Raspberry Pi as an embedded device, and then evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings (obtained by exploring changes in student performance and examining the results of an engagement/enjoyment survey) strongly indicate that the introduction of the Raspberry Pi was well received by the students and contributed positively to their learning outcomes.  2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

N2  - In this paper, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) parking management solution for roadside parking spaces. This solution includes software and sensor hardware installed at each parking space. Because the smartphone is prevalent nowadays, we also design a smartphone application to enable users to easily access information regarding parking spaces near the users destination and devise the best path to it anytime, anywhere. We choose Apple iOS as the programming platform on the smartphone and Raspberry Pi 3 as the sensor hardware, which uses an infrared distance sensor to determine whether the parking space has been occupied by a vehicle or not. We also adopt Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to connect sensors of all roadside parking lots and build a BLE mesh sensor network to collect parking statuses. A routing protocol for the BLE mesh sensor network to efficiently forward parking information to the parking management server is proposed in this paper. Finally, we present the software and sensor hardware used for implementing this parking management system, the simulator to execute the proposed BLE mesh routing algorithm, and snapshots of the parking app.  MYU K.K.

N2  - Instructional laboratories are common in engineering programs. Instructional laboratories should evolve with technology and support the changes in higher education, like the increased popularity of online courses. In this study, an affordable and portable laboratory kit was designed to replace the expensive on-campus equipment for two control systems courses. The complete kit costs under $135 and weighs under 0.68 kilograms. It is comprised of off-the-shelf components (e.g., Raspberry Pi, DC motor) and 3D printed parts. The kit has two different configurations. The first (base) configuration is a DC motor system with a position and speed sensor. The second configuration adds a Furuta inverted pendulum attachment with another position sensor. These configurations replicate most of the student learning outcomes for the two control systems courses for which they were designed.  2016 by the author.

N2  - The paper presents an engineering design approach to develop an instructional module for college students to learn Microprocessors and Robotics using multiple sensors, microprocessors and software design tools. The module consists of research analysis, lesson content development and laboratory practice selection, which satisfies the ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering  Technology) requirement for engineering education. The research analysis covers the work reported by the scholars from MIT and other universities [1] [2], where the main concern is how to enhance students' capability in developing engineering products using new technologies in the industry, such as multiple sensor fusion methodology as well as working skills on cross-platform hardware (Intel, ARM, AMD and PIC, etc.) and software (Linux, Windows and Androids, etc.). After the research paper analysis, a class activity has been developed. The activity includes teaching students to build teaming robots by combining the Cortex controllers with ROBOTC programming environment under Windows and the Raspberry Pi (in ARM cores) using Python under Linux and guiding students to develop a cross-platform software and hardware design using PIC Microcontrollers with embedded C under Windows and the Raspberry Pi with Python under Linux. The teaming robots under development contains a leading robot and a tracking robot. The leading robot in the front can turn in any direction. When it "sees" an obstacle ahead using an ultrasonic sensor, it will turn left or right to avoid the obstacle. The tracking robot has a Cortex controller to drive the motors and an ultrasonic range finder to detect the distance between it and the leading robot. At the same time, the tracking robot also holds a Raspberry Pi board with a Pi Camera on it. The image signal obtained from the Pi Camera is processed by the Raspberry Pi and sent to the Cortex controller. Based on the processed image signal, the second robot can follow the first robot to turn accordingly, thus, they make a robot team. The exercise package contains a PIC microcontroller with a speaker and the Raspberry Pi with Pi Camera. If the Pi Camera finds some motion around, a signal will be sent to the PIC microcontroller and the siren sound will be emitted. The activities largely aroused students' curiosity and attention. The survey result is very encouraging. After the class, students' enthusiasm in learning Python, image processing and engineering design using multiple boards and programming languages as well as the applications has been noticeably enhanced.

N2  - Radio amateurism is a hobby, which helped in pioneering many innovations that we are using today. Hobbyists, which use radio communication to communicate, are called Hams. Radio communications has great history and Hams are part of it. Radio amateurism is a hobby which plays great part in emergency and disaster relief situations when conventional communications became unavailable. Technology built around radio communication is suitable in education to test study cases, and gain knowledge in wireless and computer communications. Purpose of this paper is to experiment with open source VOIP software (svxlink) using, cheap microcomputer hardware, one of available Linux distributions, radio amateur frequencies, radio amateur transceivers and antennas. Different technological issues brought together in this paper such as wired and wireless communication, VOIP over Internet with voice coming from radio amateur equipment and vice versa. We also tested integrated automatic position reporting system (APRS) because svxlink has capability to dynamically update data on APRS server what is capability with potential many applications such as active and passive measuring activities of VOIP users, users' mobility, and other applicable APRS functionalities as well. In this paper are published experiences from real disaster situation during floods and mudslides which hits Bosnia and Herzegovina in May 2014.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - One of the most important application areas of signal processing (SP) is, without a doubt, the software-defined radio (SDR) field [1]-[3]. Although their introduction dates back to the 1980s, SDRs are now becoming the dominant technology in radio communications, thanks to the dramatic development of SP-optimized programmable hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and digital signal processors (DSPs). Today, the computational throughput of these devices is such that sophisticated SP tasks can be efficiently handled, so that both the baseband and intermediate frequency (IF) sections of current communication systems are usually implemented, according to the SDR paradigm, by the FPGA's reconfigurable circuitry (e.g., [4]-[6]), or by the software running on DSPs.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Monitoring of photovoltaic (PV) systems can maintain efficient operations. However, extensive monitoring of large quantities of data can be a cumbersome process. The present work introduces a simple, inexpensive, yet effective data monitoring strategy for detecting faults and determining lost revenues automatically. This was achieved through the deployment of Raspberry Pi (RPI) device at a PV system's combiner box. The RPI was programmed to collect PV data through Modbus communications, and store the data locally in a MySQL database. Then, using a Gaussian Process Regression algorithm the RPI device was able to accurately estimate string level current, voltage, and power values. The device could also detect system faults using a Support Vector Novelty Detection algorithm. Finally, the RPI was programmed to output the potential lost revenue caused by the abnormal condition. The system analytics information was then displayed on a user interface. The interface could be accessed by operations personal to direct maintenance activity so that critical issues can be solved quickly.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Monitoring of photovoltaic (PV) systems can maintain efficient operations. However, extensive monitoring of large quantities of data can be a cumbersome process. The present work introduces a simple, inexpensive, yet effective data monitoring strategy for detecting faults and determining lost revenues automatically. This was achieved through the deployment of Raspberry Pi (RPI) device at a PV system's combiner box. The RPI was programmed to collect PV data through Modbus communications, and store the data locally in a MySQL database. Then, using a Gaussian Process Regression algorithm the RPI device was able to accurately estimate string level current, voltage, and power values. The device could also detect system faults using a Support Vector Novelty Detection algorithm. Finally, the RPI was programmed to output the potential lost revenue caused by the abnormal condition. The system analytics information was then displayed on a user interface. The interface could be accessed by operations personal to direct maintenance activity so that critical issues can be solved quickly.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - Remote education in engineering has been proven to be difficult in some practical areas. However, these practical areas and, more specifically, labs are high valuable for students and very important to help them grasp their theoretical knowledge. In the electronics field labs are crucial to understand every concept, and these labs should not be only simulation-based labs but real ones. Following this course of action, VISIR has been demonstrated its ability to accomplish with this task, however some limitations appear when building some circuits and, of course, not every case is covered. A proof of concept of an FPAA based-lab controlled and supported by a Raspberry Pi will be developed in this conference paper analyzing its benefits and possible synergies with other projects and labs with the objective of accessing to the potential and features of the FPAA in remote engineering education.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - This paper primarily presents our work of employing the BeagleBone Black board, a small but powerful single-board embedded computer, to enrich the teaching materials of embedded systems design for technology students. It introduces the hardware and software features of the BeagleBone Black. It then presents the learning outcomes, contents and lab organization. The comparison of the BBB with another commonly used single board computer Raspberry Pi is also discussed. Two developed Internet of Things (IoT) relevant capstone projects are reported. Our experiences demonstrate that BBB is an easy-to-use development board which can be employed by college-level students for developing complex embedded computing systems, especially targeting at network applications.  2016 IEEE.

N2  - The original aim when creating the Raspberry Pi was to encourage "kids"-pre-university learners-to engage with programming, and to develop an interest in and understanding of programming and computer science concepts. The method to achieve this was to give them their own, low cost computer that they could use to program on, as a replacement for a family PC that often did not allow this option. With the original release, the Raspberry Pi included two programming environments in the standard distribution software: Scratch and IDLE, a Python environment. In this paper, we describe two programming environments that we developed and recently ported and optimised for the Raspberry Pi, Greenfoot and BlueJ, both using the Java programming language. Greenfoot and BlueJ are both now included in the Raspberry Pi standard software distribution, and they differ in many respects from IDLE; they are more graphical, more interactive, more engaging, and illustrate concepts of object orientation more clearly. Thus, they have the potential to support the original aim of the Raspberry Pi by creating a deeper engagement with programming. This paper describes these two environments and how they may be used, and discusses their differences and relationships to the two previously available systems.  2016 by the author.

N2  - Many introductory computer-programming classes in engineering fields stress coding skills, but they often do not incorporate data acquisition or output until later classes. Interfacing computers with laboratory equipment is an excellent way to engage and excite students who may not otherwise see the importance of programming. Additionally, they collect and process data directly instead of receiving artificially or simulated data. Our laboratory curriculum integrates the Raspberry Pi, an inexpensive and versatile single-board computer, with a standard computer to provide dynamic and engaging biomedical-engineering-related programming activities in an introductory MATLAB course, all without complicated MATLAB commands or routines. The total cost for each station is only about 75 or less. Concurrently, more complicated engineering concepts are introduced at this early level to pique interest in biomedical engineering and improve learning in later classes when these concepts are described in more detail. Students report enjoying programming more and seeing its quintessential role in engineering experiments while being better prepared for later computer-based courses and job opportunities.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a new computing paradigm that may soon add a new dimension to the skillset expected from a well-rounded computing professional. Computer Science education is addressing these demands by adding IoT-centric courses to the curriculum and including relevant content into a broad range of existing courses. This paper presents the experience of incorporating IoT projects into an existing Systems Programming course. We examine several suitable hardware platforms, provide a sampling of student projects implemented using the Raspberry Pi with a variety of sensors, and discuss a number of lessons learned that could benefit other educators planning to incorporate the IoT material into their coursework.  2017 ACM.

N2  - The Raspberry Pi is a small computer useful for teaching students basic computer knowledge. This paper discusses the integration of the Raspberry Pi in an introductory information systems course. Previously, the initial course in the College of Engineering and Information Sciences was a general applications course not focused on computer science or engineering. A new course was developed integrating the raspberry pi with hands on labs to improve student engagement. The initial course should be exciting and motivating to students. By creating a new course with interesting labs that integrate the Raspberry Pi, higher pass rates and student satisfaction will be achieved.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Learning about sensor technology and actuator early is important as a step towards knowing and introducing of advanced technologies based on Internet of Things (IoT). The difficulties are how to learn sensor technology and move the actuator with accessing General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) of Raspberry Pi 3 Platforms using programming language syntax which often confusing and difficult to understand. To help people learning IoT by using Raspberry Pi 3 with an interesting Android apps, we believe that this learning module can integrate about the ease and attractiveness of IoT System Editor based on Android apps. This research create a mobile programming apps based on Android which people can build IoT project easily with GUI without program and middleware based on Raspberry Pi to connect between apps and hardware with especially task to manage data communication, data flow, and device driver. Hopefully new developer can develop the IoT application easily by using Android mobile visual programming that combined with Raspberry Pi 3 platform.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - Academia has always sought to ride the line between established thought and new developments. No much more so than in the terms of technology. Universities seek to teach using known and proven methods and resources but also stay relevant with new technologies to provide students the knowledge they will need to be competitive in the work place or graduate field. In this work we will present how the University of Nevada approaches this problem with its Real Time Operating system course. Namely on how using the established Micro C/OS II Real time Operating System with the new builder phenomena the Raspberry Pi we can overcome the challenge of updating a tried and true lesson plan in order to use technology relevant and interesting to the students of today.

N2  - Onboard transit systems are commonly used for commutes to and from home, work and other destinations. However, this is generally not productive time with commuters often gazing out of the window. Other systems have proposed a solution to this problem however, they are offline and would require each device on each vehicle to be updated manually. In this paper, we present an onboard educational Wi-Fi system that offers educational content which can be updated remotely as well as free internet access to particular commuters. Also, specific users can be allowed to browse the internet by connecting wirelessly while onboard. Additionally, Edu-Bus can be used as an educational tool, requiring persons to watch an educational video or read some educational content before gaining access to Edu-Bus services such as free Wi-Fi. Our system uses a Raspberry Pi which is converted into a wireless hotspot, as well as an optional USB or Wi-Fi modem to connect to the 3G/4G provider. Additionally, Edu-Bus can be powered directly from an adapter using the vehicles cigarette lighter outlet or temporarily from its internal battery. We implemented this work on-board a fleet of four (4) buses at the University of The West Indies Cave Hill Campus. We analyzed student connections to the system generated by user activities. Our approach to this problem not only makes Edu-Bus extendable but also introduces the ability to deploy similar systems on varying vehicle types and modes of transportation.  2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

N2  - A compelling robotics course begins with a compelling robot. We introduce a new low-cost aerial educational platform, the PiDrone, along with an associated college-level introductory robotics course. In a series of projects, students incrementally build, program, and test their own drones to create an autonomous aircraft capable of using a downward facing RGB camera and infrared distance sensor to visually localize and maintain position. The PiDrone runs Python and the Robotics Operating System (ROS) framework on an onboard Raspberry Pi, providing an accessible and inexpensive platform for introducing students to robotics. Students can use any web and SSH capable computer as a base station and programming platform. The projects and supplementary homeworks introduce PID control, state estimation, and high-level planning, giving students the opportunity to exercise their new skills in an exciting long-term project.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, an intruder detection system has been built with an implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) using raspberry pi, Microsoft's Azure and Twilio cloud systems. The CNN algorithm which is stored in the cloud is implemented to basically classify input data as either intruder or user. By using the raspberry pi as the middleware and raspberry pi camera for image acquisition, efficient execution of the learning and classification operations are performed using higher resources that cloud computing offers. The cloud system is also programmed to alert designated users via multimedia messaging services (MMS) when intruders or users are detected. Furthermore, our work has demonstrated that, though convolutional neural network could impose high computing demands on a processor, the input data could be obtained with low-cost modules and middleware which are of low processing power while subjecting the actual learning algorithm execution to the cloud system.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - This educational project uses a second generation Raspberry Pi that runs multiple Open Source software packages, to perform network penetration testing and to analyze the results. Implementing this project provides undergraduate students with practical hands-on experience and explains advanced concepts in computer hardware, operating systems, and network security. This project is fairly affordable, highly portable, easily deployable, alarmingly impactful, and highly rewarding. It also demonstrates the need for secure wireless networks against various attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM). This paper illustrates step-by-step instructions to assemble and integrate the project's hardware parts, to download and configure software packages, and to perform customized network operations such as packet sniffing and filtering. Kali Linux for Raspberry Pi is the chosen operating system due to its extensive and powerful collection of White Hat hacking tools such as Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer), Nmap (Network Mapper), and SSLstrip (Secure Sockets Layer strip). Additional wireless network auditing tools are used from the robust FruityWifi package. Wireshark filters, captures, and analyzes network packets, such as hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) requests. SSLstrip strips the secure connection and convert HTTPS to hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), gaining access to sensitive information such as login credentials. This simple to implement yet powerful project, demonstrates the ease of hiding and discreetly deploying a Raspberry Pi on a vulnerable wireless network to sniff network packets that is considered protected behind firewalls, while maintaining a safe distance and anonymity from the target.

N2  - (work in progress). In 2012, Ebon Upton started the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which introduced the Raspberry Pi (RPi) as a $35 basic computer. The goal was to reignite public interest in programming and increase enrollment in college computer science. Today, the third RPi iteration features a multicore processor, a small GPU for display graphics, WiFi, Bluetooth, and USB connectivity. Surprisingly, even though the RPi has become very popular with the public and college students for do-it-yourself projects and maker culture, instructors have not widely used it to teach operating systems concepts. In this paper, I share my experience using the RPi in my Operating Systems class. The paper makes the following contributions:  Pedagogical advantages of using the RPi over other traditional and cloud-based methods to teach operating systems concepts  Challenges for the instructor and students running many RPis in a classroom setting over the campus enterprise network.  Advantages of using the RPi to stimulate student creativity and motivate them to design and implement their own related computing projects.  2017 IEEE.

N2  - The light field is a 4D function that represents the radiance of light traveling in every direction through every point in 3D space. In this paper, we demonstrate how effectively 4D light fields can be sampled from the real world using a custom-built 4D light field camera system constructed based on cheaply and commonly available Raspberry Pi computers. The camera system consisting of a camera array and a dedicated calibration software is flexible and scalable in structure because the system can be reconfigured easily to meet the users needs. We show the effectiveness of the camera system by interactively visualizing captured 4D light fields using our GPU-accelerated light field renderer supporting a virtual camera model that synthesizes various photographic effects including zooming and panning, refocusing, focus breathing, and depth-of-field control. We believe that the do-it-yourself 4D light field camera will be explored effectively in traditional application fields, such as computer graphics and vision, and in other areas like science education.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Similar to a fingerprint search system, face recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects or finding missing persons. Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect's face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer's uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in accurate detection of faces compared to state-of-the-art face detection and recognition methods, and verify its effectiveness for enhancing law-enforcement services in smart cities.  2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - For different purposes, a service robot that can be controlled remotely will play a significant role in the expansion of robotics automation systems. In the developing countries like Bangladesh, everyone is concerned about safety from both natural and human-made situations like Disposal of Bombs, rescuing objects from dangerous places, a useful assistant for handicapped people. In this paper, we propose to make a Robotic Car (RC) which helps to enter an environment of higher risks, grab and move to an appropriate place. For developing this generic model, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ is used as the central control unit for the robot. Six Degree of Freedom (DOF) Arm is used to compute as the main factor for grabbing the objects. Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter is the remote handheld controller for the RC. Also, a raspberry pi 0.6MP camera is integrated for live video streaming. The live streaming will provide the actual scenario of the environment to operate, control and navigate the RC. This robot also carries some important sensors like Gas sensor, Ultrasonic Sonar Sensor and 3-Axis Digital Compass to bring out the scientific task of the robot. This prototype can be both used for educational and research purpose. The performance of the robot can be measured by the transmission of the video streaming, control system success rate for RF controller, outcomes of the sensors and the accuracy of the 6 DOF Arm.  2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is made up of many devices, platforms, and communication protocols. Among them, Raspberry Pi has arisen as one of the most popular equipment for hobby and education purposes because of its low cost, small size, flexibility, and potential. Nevertheless, Raspberry Pi needs an operating system to work, which exposes it to software vulnerabilities despite the many advantages it provides in comparison with nonoperating system devices. This device also has hardware limitations, which impact on its security. These limitations exist because some concessions had to be done during the design in order to decrease the cost of the device. This article analyzes different hardware and software vulnerabilities that can be found in a Raspberry Pi when using a default installation of different available operating systems. Finally, we propose a list of good practices to minimize the presented issues.  2012 IEEE.

N2  - Our paper describes a challenging and enjoyable undergraduate student project that details the process of configuring a Raspberry Pi into an advanced multimedia player as a headless system controllable by infrared remote or secure shell (SSH) protocol. This paper provides a methodological, step-by-step set of specific instructions on how to replicate this project. The undergraduate student applied concepts from operating systems (OS), networks, and electronics into practical steps to exploit readily available open-source software packages and highly-customizable hardware components. Electronic components were soldered to build a modified printed circuit board (PCB) with a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen and push-buttons, and were successfully combined with an external sound card, wireless universal serial bus (USB) card, and an infrared (IR) receiver into a fully assembled, affordable, and reliable device. This developed device can be controlled using any IR-capable remote, is capable of playing high-quality audio, and circumvents advertisements on the free audio streaming web service Pandora Radio using a pre-existing free or paid account. Using this device improves the user's experience of Pandora Radio in several ways while keeping this device portable and preserving all functionality of the Raspberry Pi itself. The goal of this project is to use available tools and integrate various technological fields into a deliverable consumer product. Consumer electronics continue to place increasing emphasis on supporting open-source hardware and software, and the Raspberry Pi provides an affordable, flexible, multi-purpose platform for both beginners and experts to personalize into a wide range of useful and specialized products.

N2  - This paper presents a new approach to develop remote practices for Systems Engineering and Automatic Control laboratories based on Easy JavaScript Simulations (EJsS), Raspberry Pi and Node.js. EJsS is used to create a JavaScript and HTML5 laboratory front-end that lets teachers and students parametrize and observe the behavior of the controllers/systems under study from the web-browsers of their tablets and smartphones. The Raspberry Pi, a low-cost single-board computer, is in charge of running 1) the C program that closes the control loop over the selected plant and 2) the JavaScript laboratory web server that hosts the laboratory front-end and communicates it with the controller. Finally, the JavaScript development and runtime platform Node.js is used 1) to develop and run the Javascript laboratory web sever within the Raspberry Pi and 2) to support the communications between the laboratory front-end and server. The new strategy, tested over a Proportional/Integral/Differential (PID) controller for a vertical mono-rotor plant, provides low-cost real-time support to the controller and friendly remote access from mobile devices to the practices for the students.  2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Facial expression recognition is an active research area for which the research community has presented a number of approaches due to its diverse applicability in different real-world situations such as real-time suspicious activity recognition for smart security, monitoring, marketing, and group sentiment analysis. However, developing a robust application with high accuracy is still a challenging task mainly due to the inherent problems related to human emotions, lack of sufficient data, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel, cost-effective, and energy-efficient framework designed for suspicious activity recognition based on facial expression analysis for smart security in law-enforcement services. The Raspberry Pi camera captures the video stream and detects faces using the Viola Jones algorithm. The face region is pre-processed using Gabor filter and median filter prior to feature extraction. Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) features are then extracted and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained, which predicts the known emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise). Based on the collective emotions of the faces, we predict the sentiment behind the scene. Using this approach, we predict if a certain situation is hostile and can prevent it prior to its occurrence. The system is tested on three publically available datasets: Cohen Kande (CK+), MMI, and JAFEE. A detailed comparative analysis based on SURF, SIFT, and ORB is also presented. Experimental results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system in accurate recognition of suspicious activity compared to state-of-the-art methods and validate its superiority for enhancing security in law enforcement services.  2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - In today's fast paced world where everything is changing so quickly with technology, our education system' model still remains the same. Especially when it comes to the quality of practical learning in Computer Science and Engineering courses, even e-Learning lacks far behind. In order to bridge the gap between what students are made to study in textbooks and what actually runs inside the computer system, we have taken one of the most important area of Computer Science and Engineering i.e. CPU scheduling policies in operating systems. Till now we have just taught students about the working behavior of scheduling policies either diagrammatically or through simulation, but here we are presenting the real-time implementation of scheduling policies by creating various kernels for different types of operating systems which run first-in, first-out (FIFO) or round-robin (RR) respectively. This helps students to understand and appreciate the behavior of these scheduling policies in a real-time environment and to analyze various parameters practically. The analyzed behavior makes students understand about the advantages and drawbacks of each policy practically on a real-time system. This research work also helps students in realizing that the behavior of a particular scheduling policy is not same for all types of systems. It varies when we change the type of processors and processes in an operating system. Each policy has a different behavior on different system and not exactly same as what they study in textbooks.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - This paper presents an application of the Raspberry Pi for detecting laser spot using the OpenCV library. To capture the image, a Web-Camera connected to the USB port of the Raspberry Pi is employed. Since the Raspberry Pi is small in size, the module could be mounted on the gun for laser shooting. Compared to the existing laser shooting, our method has benefit in the flexibility of laser shooting mechanism, where the shooter could move the gun freely without the restriction of the camera's cable connection. The image processing tasks and interfacing to the camera could be accomplished by the Raspberry Pi mounted on the gun. Experimental results show that the proposed system could detect the laser spots under the varying backgrounds, lighting conditions, and shooting distances effectively. The processing speed of 18 fps could be achieved for real time implementation.  2014 IEEE.

N2  - The resulting of advanced technology, the size of Personal Computer (PC) was reduced into the same size as cigarette box. Thus, the Brinell-macro-hardness tester used Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3) Model B to acted as the Data Acquisition System (DAS) or the mini-PC which used for measuring of Active-Weight-Loading (AWL) parameters. This DAS used the triplex of force-resistive sensors equipped using IC-MCP3008 and interfaced with RPi3. This IC was used to converse the analogue signal of AWL to 10 bits of the digital signal, and then, the digitalized-data were transferred through the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) of RPi3, respectively. In the acquisition procedure, the real-time of measuring-data were revealed using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) which developed using the python language version 2.7. Consequently, it was perceived that this DAS can be fabricated using simple and low-cost design. Therefore, this contrivance can be regularly used for AWL measurement which is the one part of Brinell hardness measurement. Finally, the fabrication of electronic parts and software interfacing which manipulated using RPi3 were presented in the discussion section.  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - The Houston Toad is an endangered amphibian living in the edge of extinction. To save from annihilation, localization of their mating call needs to be detected in order to protect the eggs from being hunted by predators. The current method of monitoring their vocalization lacks real-time and onboard voice recognition property. In this paper, a solar powered battery connected to a Raspberry Pi is designed with a microphone that records environmental sound at prescribed intervals triggered by a Witty Pi module. The purpose for developing such prototype is to deploy a trained neural network predictor model to identify Houston Toad onboard, and if it exists, send notification of time stamp and location via email and SMS over the GSM and GPRS modules to the researcher.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Telepresence robots in static pan-tilt form can be a viable and affordable choice for tele-education. However, cost considerations may impose limitations on usability and expected performance. The goal of this study was to explore the usability of a low-cost, static pan-tilt telepresence robot operated using an Android smartphone. Experiments were carried out with 26 participants from two age groups (14 students M = 20 years, 12 staff M = 25 years) in a laboratory. Each participant interacted with the robot to perform two tasks. The opinions of the participants preand post-experiments, and the time they took to complete the tasks, were recorded. The results show that the average latency (of 3.1  0.8 s for one robot movement) is quite acceptable. The students were faster than the staff when controlling the robot remotely but slower when working at the robot site. Correlation analysis shows that confidence in the robot and the likelihood of adoption is strongly related to data privacy features. All the methods used to control the robot remotely show positive interaction to each other. This implies that the majority of participants were focussed on the control methods and data privacy provided in the robot platform, and were willing to accept a small delay in robot movement.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) is being used more and more nowadays. While this makes our lives much easier, offering modern solutions like smart homes or cars, it also brings new security issues in this area: sensors and other similar IoT devices with scarce resources and functionality have limited ways of providing appropriate security, and every day there is an increasing number of malicious users taking advantage of this. As providing per-device protection is difficult or even impossible, a much better solution would be to do this in centralized manner, from the network router all local IoT devices are connected to. In this paper we propose a router-level IoT security method using a Raspberry Pi configured as a network router. We describe the necessary steps to conFigure the proposed security infrastructure, some possible attacks (e.g. SQL-injection, DoS, brute-force attacks) and defense strategies we developed against them.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Space weather research is an important aspect in studying and monitoring the effects of extraterrestrial forces outside the earth on human activities. Stanford University under International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI) program has developed first generation of sudden ionospheric detection named as SuperSID. To enable the usage of this system for community outreach space science education program, a portable and low cost system need to be developed. Raspberry Pi can be used as the main processor for the SID system. It can be easily operated without the need of a personal computer. However, the available sound card are limited and sampling rate is on 48 kHz. This limit the detection of the VLF frequency detection to approximately 22 kHz. Thus it become a limiting factor to view the VLF spectrum in a full range (3-30 kHz). To overcome this problem, a VLF receiver system with a better sound card (Audio Injector) was proposed to detect the signal in a full VLF spectrum with the objective for a better data analysis. The hardware aspects including an antenna, a preamplifier, a sound card (Audio Injector) and a microprocessor (Raspberry Pi) with LCD Touchscreen as its monitor display. The VLF acquisition software part consists of an acquisition software executable by Python programming language with additional modules that runs in Raspberry Pi. Finally a portable VLF receiver system with maximum sampling rate of 96 kHz has been developed to capture VLF signal between 3-30 kHz.  2019 IEEE.

N2  - Sensor networks are a highly researched application area in the field of Internet of Things (IoT). A key cost and resource question in the development of IoT network sensor solutions is prototype implementation. In this study, the Raspberry Pi-a widely used single board computer-is investigated as it is one of the most commonly used prototyping devices available and is also widely used in scientific research. In this paper, we address which technologies, the usefulness and what kinds of issues arise when the prototyping of a sensor network solution is done with Raspberry Pi. The extant literature is studied by selecting papers with the systematic literature review method. Based on an extensive survey of the selected studies, we found several sensor-based implementations where Raspberry Pi has been used. In addition, this survey revealed subjects, such as e-health and education, which expanded the research topic in new ways. Further research opportunities have been identified in specifying the usefulness of various technologies with single board computers.  2017 Croatian Society MIPRO.

N2  - The miniature Raspberry Pi computer has become of interest to many researchers as a platform for building sociotechnical IoT systems for end-users; however, for the end-user to design and build such apps themselves requires new people-oriented tools and design methods. This chapter describes a people-oriented design method called TANDEM and demonstrates the use of it in detail, by way of a case study- the design of a mashup of services and local data stores-that solves the so-called movie-cinema problem. An implementation of the newly designed movie-cinema app is then built within the DigitalFriend, an end-user programmer IDE. Furthermore, a significant part of the TANDEM design method is then automated within the development tool itself. This automation removes the most skilled task required by TANDEM of the end-user: The automation of the process of data normalization. The automation applies data normalization to the initial model of components and data sources that feed into the mashup. The presentation here relies on some understanding of data normalization, so a simple example is presented. After this demonstrated example of the method and the implementation, the authors discuss the applicability of a model achievable by end-users using TANDEM coupled with the automated normalization process built into the IDE vs. using a top-down model by an experienced information analyst. In conclusion, the TANDEM method combined with the automation as demonstrated does empower an end-user to a significant degree in achieving a workable mashup of distributed services and local data stores and feeds. Such a powerful combination of methods and tools will help the Raspberry Pi to become a significant people-oriented platform, beyond just a platformfor teaching novices to code. Furthermore, the TANDEM method does have broader applicability to designing a broad class of logic programs, complementing the use of collected patterns in logic programs.  2018 by IGI Global.

N2  - Modern memory hierarchies are complex pieces of hardware, combining memory controllers, caches, and memory-management units in a desperate attempt to keep modern high-speed processors fed with data. Recent developments, including the introduction of nonvolatile memory, further complicate the situation. Operating systems are highly tuned to current memory systems; modifying them to take advantage of new developments is a difficult process. The low-level code involved is complex and hard to follow. This makes teaching students about modern memory systems a struggle, as wading through the complicated code in a full operating system like Linux can be frustrating. To this end we develop vmwOS, a simple operating system designed for low-cost Raspberry Pi development boards. Although inexpensive, these widely used boards support most of the features of modern memory systems, including 64-bit addresses, multi-level caches, multi-core, and full ARMv8 processor and MMU support. vmwOS is simple enough that students can follow the code and make modifications for memory hierarchy exploration. We describe a number of memory research topics that can be explored with this infrastructure, including a detailed examination of simulating non-volatile RAM support.  2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The electrochemical sensor exploits current or voltage on the electrodes when the chemical reaction occurs between the sensitive part of the electrode and the heavy metal ion detected. The output of current or voltage changes corresponds to the amount of ion concentration of heavy metal in water. This research aims to develop signal processing system using raspberry PI as a supporting electronic scheme of electrochemical sensor to detect and analize heavy metal pollutant. The system contains of potentiostat, signal conditioning and data acquisition schemes. This research covers the activities of the design and development of Raspberry Pi based supporting electronic scheme, PCB and the electronic components, as well as the software program for the measurement of signal input from the electrochemical sensor. The performance of K500 system developed in the research is a little bit lower than that of the system published by another researcher. Despite its performance, this system costs only $45 cheaper than previous system that costs $100. For full version, i.e. including Raspberry Pi as a server, the K500 system with the dimension of 110x90x70 mm costs only $70, cheaper than the other system using laptop computer as a server that costs $60 without its server.

N2  - The demand for more efficient and environmentally benign, non-conventional sources of energy came into picture due to increasing demands for human comforts. Solar energy is now the ultimate option. In this paper, the instruments used to measure the solar radiation at Innovation Centre, MIT Manipal were connected to a Raspberry Pi to access the data remotely. Genetic Algorithms were formulated, so that the monthly mean global solar radiation in Manipal can be effectively estimated. Meteorological data such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, etc. were used as inputs to train the networks. A successful network was made between the data loggers and the Raspberry Pi. The data collected by the data loggers from the devices are transmitted to the Raspberry Pi which in turn sends the data to an internal server. The Raspberry Pi can be accessed using any SSH client such as PuTTY. The meteorological data was collected for the years 2010-2014 in order to formulate the Artificial Intelligence models. The validity of the formulated models were checked by comparing the measured data with the estimated data using tools such as RMSE, correlation coefficient, etc. The modelling of solar radiation using GA was carried out in GeneXpro tools version 5.0.  2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

N2  - A talking pen is the evolutional way of learning especially for children because it is fun and interactive. Commercial talking pen use a small infrared camera to capture the hidden dot patterns that hidden around a book's page. Specific sounds are generated according to the location of the pen on the pages. This image processing for recognition technique is complex and need calculation power because it had to calculate relative location and orientation of dots in a group. Although, the talking pen is successful product but it is not flexible to add new pattern or uses different set of patterns. In this research, the new approach for hidden dot pattern recognition is proposed. Convolutional neural networks or CNNs is selected as the recognition software. The system is built on Raspberry Pi Zero W hardware with Raspbian operating system and TensorFlow platform. MobileNet is used in the research since it small and effective for limited resources platform. MobileNet is trained by using the infrared images that captured by infrared camera module that connected to Raspberry Pi. Result shows that the accuracy of the proposed method is good enough and the response is fast enough to be implemented into the real-time commercial product and has ability to expand to any other kind of patterns without limit because the learned network can be updated easily without alter recognition software.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - Small credit-card-sized single-board computers, such as the Raspberry Pi, are becoming ever more popular in areas unrelated to the education of children, for which they were originally intended. So far, these computers have mainly been used in small-scale projects focusing very often on hardware aspects. We want to take single-board computer architectures a step further by showing how to deploy part of an orchestration platform (OpenStack Swift) on a Raspberry Pi cluster to make it a useful platform for more sophisticated data collection and analysis applications located at the edge of a cloud. Our results illustrate that this is indeed possible, but that there are still shortcomings in terms of performance. Nevertheless, with the next generation of small single-board computers that have been introduced recently, we believe that this is a viable approach for certain application domains, such as private clouds or edge computing in harsh environments.

N2  - Wireless sensor network applications in the agricultural sector are gaining popularity with the advancement of the Internet of Things technology. Predominantly, wireless sensor networks are used in agriculture to sense the important agricultural field parameters, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture level, nitrite content in the soil, groundwater quality, and so on. These sensed parameters will be sent to a remote station, where it will be processed and analyzed to build a decision support system. This paper describes the implementation of a wireless visual sensor network for precision agriculture to monitor paddy crop for weeds using Raspberry Pi. Bluetooth 4.0 was used by visual sensor nodes to send the data to the base station. Base station forwarded the data to the remote station using IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n standard. The solar cell battery was used to power up the sensor nodes and the base station. At the remote station, images were preprocessed to remove soil background and different shape features were extracted. Random forest and support vector machine classifiers were used to classify the paddy crop and weed based on the shape features. The results and observations obtained from the experimental setup of the system in a small paddy field are also reported. This system could be expected to enhance the crop production by giving timely advice to the crop producers about the presence of weeds so that steps can be taken to eradicate weeds.  2013 IEEE.

N2  - Middleware is a software layer located between software (operating system) and hardware (physical). This layer is flexible, where middleware can be built with a variety of features for many functions or even spesific tasks. Typically, middleware used in distributed system for software development. In this paper, the middleware created using Python parallel programming language and will be planted on Raspberry Pi 3. To help people learning IoT for basic, we create console apps for send and receiving command line data to access sensor or actuator. This middleware serves to translate a line of commands used to run or access the various features contained in IoT module. For the time efficiency of program function execution, multiprocessing or multithreading is used in Python. The multiprocessing or multithreading used in Python is expected to create middleware with distributed process for more efficient processor, to provide heterogeneity access of sensor or actuator, more simply hardware interfacing and to enhance collaboration between application and hardware. At the last, we compare multiprocessing and multithreading for CPU bond and memory usage.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - In this paper, it is aimed to implement object detection and recognition algorithms for a robotic arm platform. With these algorithms, the objects that are desired to be grasped by the gripper of the robotic arm are recognized and located. In the experimental setup that established, OWI-535 robotic arm with 4 DOF and a gripper, which is similar to the robotic arms used in the industry, is preferred. Local feature-based algorithms such as SIFT, SURF, FAST, and ORB are used on the images which are captured via the camera to detect and recognize the target object to be grasped by the gripper of the robotic arm. These algorithms are implemented in the software for object recognition and localization, which is written in C++ programming language using OpenCV library and the software runs on the Raspberry Pi embedded Linux platform. In the experimental studies, the performance of the features which are extracted with the SIFT, SURF, FAST, and ORB algorithms are compared. This study, which is first implemented with OWI-535 robotic arm, shows that the local feature-based algorithms are suitable for education and industrial applications.  2018 IEEE.

N2  - The convenience for most people is to have the ability to control or view details of surveillance made by a robotic system even when they are not at home. In this paper, we design an efficient robot that is capable of video surveillance even at night. The method consists of a web based wireless controlled night vision surveillance robot using Shell script with raspberry pi. The web page has video screen for surveillance and buttons to control robot and camera. For proper surveillance at night, a night vision camera has been implemented. The web page is the command control center for the robot, which can be run in both computer and mobile phone (IOS/Android). The signal, which is generated from web page, are sent to Raspberry pi through Wi-Fi and Raspberry pi receives these signals according to Shell Script written in Raspberry pi. Therefore, the commands are processed and the robot is directed with user directive. The Video Streaming is done using MJPG streamer program that gets MJPEG data and the movement of the robot is controlled by Shell Script which sends it through a HTTP session. The result shows that the video streamed up to 15 frames per second.  2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - In smart factory, the IoT (Internet of things) is applied to capture the data generated by the production facility, store and analyze data generated in real time using Big Data technology. A parallel distributed processing system for big data analysis and processing requires a large-capacity server and a high cost to build infrastructure. In acquisition of shop floor data, Raspberry-Pi which is a low cost single board computer is very efficient device for big data clustering. In this paper, we show an case study on the feasibility of Raspberry-Pi as a big data cluster in smart factory.  2018 IEEE.
